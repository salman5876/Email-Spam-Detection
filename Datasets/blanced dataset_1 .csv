' this is clearly a hard problem ( e . g . does this just  mean response - time measurement , can it be done by passive means , how  should the measurements be presented , etc . ) .  in short  - rtfm provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic  volumes  - ippm has concentrated on transport - layer behaviour of the  current , best - effort internet .  - rmonmib is beginning to consider application - layer measurement ",0

"Subject: extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe - cera  insight  title : extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe  url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2184  overview : a comprehensive reform of gas legislation in central and eastern  europe is bringing the region in line with the european union  , s gas  directive . this is true both for the countries expected to enter the union by  2004  ) 05  * czech republic , estonia , hungary , poland , and slovenia - - and for  candidates whose entry is not scheduled before the end of the  decade - - bulgaria , latvia , lithuania , romania , and slovakia . in cera  , s view  current developments regarding the establishment of a legal framework for the  internal gas market in eastern and central europe look promising from an  investor  , s point of view .  the candidate countries presented a review of progress made in the  implementation of the eu gas directive during a two - day workshop held by the  european commission and the world bank in paris in november .  many of these countries have been reforming their energy industries  throughout the 1990 s as part of their transition to a market economy . the  results have been mixed , particularly in the utility industries . the 1998 gas  directive ( adopted in august 2000 ) now offers a compelling incentive for eu  candidate countries to transform their gas industries , while providing a road  map to guide them .  the critical points relevant to harmonization between the european union and  candidate countries include the following :  * legal framework and regulation . the legal framework is the cornerstone of  enlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in europe . as a result , in all  candidate countries in 1999  ) 2000 energy laws were either updated or newly  established along the principles spelled out in the gas directive . regulatory  bodies have been created by law and are operating in every country , although  issues of staffing , financial autonomy , and independence from political  influence are not uniformly resolved .  * third - party access ( tpa ) and long - term take - or - pay contracts . all candidate  countries agree that tpa is a key to market competition . therefore , all have  adopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation . although the  commission favors regulated tpa , the specific approaches to tpa enforcement  in the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases . in particular , the  implementation of tpa will have to address the issue of long - term take - or - pay  contracts with russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies  and somewhat preempt competition . russian gas is for the most part sold to  single , traditional state - owned operators that dominate their internal  markets . a balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant  players and the competitive environment . this is made more complicated by  their ownership of large volumes of russian gas supplied in kind in exchange  for transit rights to west european customers . article 25 of the directive  provides for !  a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from take - or - pay  obligations . this derogation would apply to the companies of candidate  countries with historical and commercial links with the russian gas industry .  furthermore , article 26 allows derogations to those member states with only  one major gas supplier , to those with an  +  + emerging gas market  status ,  ,  , or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of another  member state . most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to  call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the  european union .  * price cross - subsidies . residential gas tariffs are artificially low and are  financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers . in  various countries , tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have  been scheduled , but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce .  this has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage of  imported gas to oil prices . all candidate countries have set legal frameworks  that include the phasing out of cross - subsidies as part of sector reform , but  the actual implementation will remain politically difficult . as table 1  indicates , price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expected  to enter the european union by mid - decade , but the legal framework itself  cannot guarantee the pace of reform . the same goes for candidate countries  that have only recently introduced eu - complying energy laws and whose entry  to the european union is likely to happen in a longer time frame .  * unbundling . most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission  companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of  liberalization . to date , unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is  all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countries .  in the future , the commission is likely to press all eu countries for legal  separation (  & structural unbundling  8 ) of the businesses , and candidate  countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly .  table 1 gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries . as the  table shows , the countries belonging to the second group have only very  recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the  directive , whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries  scheduled for the first wave .  * * end * *  follow above url for full report .  come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids :  strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 - 16 ,  2001 !

"Subject: re : status  clayton ,  we can discuss your request when i come back to the office on monday .  regarding the trip to portland . such a trip requires an explicit prior  permission from your boss ,  myself in his absence , or stinson in my and vasant ' s absence .  in case you did not ask for such a permission before , the request is denied .  vince  clayton vernon @ enron  07 / 20 / 2000 03 : 12 pm  to : vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect  cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  subject : status  vasant -  i hope you had a wonderful vacation back home , and are rested and recovered  from the long flight back .  i wanted to give you an update of the eol project , the gas model , and of my  intentions here at enron .  software ( in compiled c on the unix platform ) has been developed and debugged  to listen to the eol trades , process them , book them , and file them away . in  addition , software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on  a continual basis , and to store the entirety of open positions on eol in a  dynamic matrix facilitating analysis . it has yet to get back with me on how  the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit  purposes .  these data files are stored in a format for reading by excel or by sas , for  which i have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines  elucidating the structure of the data .  i am in the process of documenting all of this for you .  with regards the gas model and its slow performance on the compaq , dell has  agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the compaq , to see if  the performance issue of the lp is related to the compaq . i have been  researching this issue with it here and with compaq and dell . the new machine  will be here any day now ( no financial obligation to anyone ) , and i will be  able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is  compaq - specific .  i am also in the process of documenting the gas model for you .  i ' ve tried to do my best for you , vasant , but i have been frustrated by not  only the death of my mother but some internal systems in it here . just the  other day , sas could not open a full query of the eol database because there  wasn ' t enough free space on the server ' s hard drive for the workfiles . in  discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power  trading , people whom i have known for over 10 years , they indicated they were  ubiquitous here . the power traders have similar pc ' s to my new one , and they  have complained from day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones . also ,  there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses ;  during my brief tenure here it has gone through two differing proposals as to  how to address this . when i have been told of tools available for real - time  data harvesting , my requests for such have typically been met with "" well , we  have it , but we haven ' t really tested it yet . "" an example is the weather : we  still do not record to disk the hourly nws observations from the goes  satellite .  my interests here are to help enron to do well , because i will do well only  if enron does well . these aren ' t empty words - my ira is 100 % invested in the  enron stock fund . i believe my best contributions to enron will be in the  areas of systems as well as modeling , and the difficulty working in the  research group , in terms of systems development , is that , frankly , few people  at enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems . we aren ' t  directly generating revenues for enron , and we aren ' t really their customers ,  except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses .  as it happens , power trading posted an opening for a modeling and forecasting  person , and i spoke with them and they asked me to take the job , reporting to  george hopley . it is a wonderful opportunity for me , vasant , as they are  interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their  traders ' access to real - time fundamentals data . i was completely candid with  kevin presto regarding my shortcomings here in research - i told him you were  disgusted with me because i repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines . they  also understand i have yet to be at enron for 1 year , and thus may only bid  on a job with your permission . we agree the move is good for enron ; we all  work for enron , and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but  merely permit it . they are comfortable with me - they have known me for years  as a hard worker , honest and unpretensive . they have already ordered a  state - of - the - art unix workstation and server for me , and they have told me  they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful ,  including hiring an analyst to work for me . and , i have already been able to  teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis i  have learned here .  so , i am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening . it would be  a lateral move in position and salary , and i would commit to you to help you  in any way possible in the future with regards the gas model or the eol  database . i will continue to work on their improvement , and complete their  documentation .  as it happens , i am away on enron business in portland monday and tuesday ,  and will be back wednesday . i had wanted to talk face - to - face instead of by  email , but enron business supercedes - i am on a team designing the data  warehouse for floor trader support .  clayton .",0

"" along  with the progress in the implementation of the pjm west concept , this  initiative  will provide an even broader standardized market design .

"" this new market design , together with our  efforts to address the market "" seams "" and other coordination issues , will  eventually bring the three northeast iso markets closer together .

"" in last november itself , mseb had sent an official intimation to the state  government informing its decision in favour of cancellation of the two  projects on several grounds - - including they being unviable and  unaffordable , "" sources said . "" reliance ' s project is no different from that of  dpc ' s . patalganga is also naphtha - based and its ppa is on similar lines . . .  after the enron experience , mseb cannot even dream of another gas - based  power plant in the state , "" a senior mseb official said . he said mseb has  already asked the state government not to provide escrow to both the 447 - mw  patalganga and the 1 , 084 - mw coal - based bhadravati , "" as the us energy major  has almost squeezed us of all over finances "" . when contacted , mseb chairman  vinay bansal said : "" reliance and ispat projects have been put on hold as per  the godbole committee ' s recommendations "" , but expressed inability to give  further details .  currently , bhadravati and patalganga projects have been put on hold as per  godbole committee report , which was set up to review the dpc - mseb ppa and  energy scenario in maharashtra . "" can you go ahead with the project without an  escrow cover ? "" the committee was believed to have asked ispat and reliance  representatives , to which the reply had been negative , sources added .  sources said , as of now , both the projects have not been able to achieve  financial closure as leading financial institutions were not willing to  fund the projects which do not have a "" guaranteed payment "" mechanism from  mseb , which , incidentally it has promised to dpc . "" all the three were cleared  as ' fast - track ' projects , but other than enron , reliance and ispat have been  caught in a quagmire , especially bhadravati , which has been hanging afire  since last nine years , "" they added .  moreover , the mseb official opined that given the current situation , if dpc  calls it quits from india , bhadravati was a safer bet than reliance ' s  patalganga . patalganga ' s power would be mere 50 paise less than that of dpc ' s  that ranges anywhere around approximately rs 4 . 50 per unit to as high as rs  7 , while bhadravati ' s cost could be around rs 3 . 80 to rs 4 per unit , he  informed . mseb ' s installed capacity ended on march 31 , 2001 , wasl 4 , 000 mw and  it has generated 45 , 000 million units with transmission and distribution  losses as high as 39 per cent .

"Subject: california update 5 / 4 / 01  if you have any questions , please contact kristin walsh at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 .  bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack of support  sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance / bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline . any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart . according to sources , both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis . the democratic caucus is reportedly "" unwilling to fight "" for davis . many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that , once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund , davis would "" double dip "" into the fund . clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor . however , it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place . additionally , some generator sources have reported that some of the long - term power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very difficult .  the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would "" eat "" the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8 billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor ' s plan for handling the crisis , including the details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they will support the bond issuance to go forward .  currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ; ab 8 x and ab 31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen , currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen ' s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) .  according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature , republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued . other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally , lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan .  key points of the bridge financing  initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b  lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b  lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b  bear stearns $ 625 m  tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ; $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax - exempt  projected interest rate : taxable rate 5 . 77 %  tax - exempt rate 4 . 77 %  current projected  blended ir : 5 . 38 %  maturity date : august 29 , 2001  for more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510  bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time  the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis .  socal edison and bankruptcy  at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash .  the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan ) stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers , then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments .",0

"Subject: organizational changes  we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes  are intended to accomplish four key objectives :  first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful  business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe .  this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built  around a relatively small strategic asset position .  second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting  relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to  directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units  has become increasingly difficult .  third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising  the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or  hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding  asset positions .  and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to  redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities .  enron wholesale services  today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate  our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale  businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and  coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to  higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of  opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of  enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and  markets .  enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european  ( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets  operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit  as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant  businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this  new structure as described below .  mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume  the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley ,  currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office  of the chairman as president and chief operating officer .  providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our  international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership  positions :  rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president  and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility  for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north  america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo  will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will  report to the ews office of the chairman .  sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the  middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our  broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region  will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of  the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for  enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business  into enron global assets in the near future .  diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined  ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will  focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term  attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to  the ebs office of the chairman .  jim bannantine , currently co - ceo of enron south america , will be joining ees  to lead ees  , commercial efforts outside north america and europe . in order  to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to  facilitate our asset sales activities , jim will remain in south america for  at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south  america . throughout the transition , jim will report to cliff baxter and to  the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . following the  transition , jim will join ees .  in addition to these changes in our international asset operations  activities , we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale  businesses and the commercial support functions :  enron net works  louise kitchen will assume greg  , s previous responsibilities as president and  ceo of enron net works , reporting into mark and greg .  enron americas  concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for  operating enron  , s south and central america asset base , all trading ,  marketing , and new asset development activities in these regions will report  into a new entity , enron americas . enron americas will have responsibility  for all wholesale merchant businesses across north , central and south  america . dave delainey , president and ceo , and john lavorato , chief  operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron  americas .  enron europe  the enron europe organization , which includes enron  , s businesses in australia  and japan , and enron metals , remains unchanged under the leadership of john  sherriff , president and ceo , and michael brown , chief operating officer .  enron global markets  enron global markets , under the leadership of mike mcconnell , president and  ceo , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer , will continue to have  responsibility for enron  , s middle east and lng operations . with the  exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico , all operating power plants and  associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to  enron global assets . enron global markets will also continue to manage the  commodity businesses in crude and products , coal , weather , insurance ,  equities , interest rates , foreign exchange , and agricultural products .  enron industrial markets  enron industrial markets  , organization , under the leadership of jeff mcmahon ,  president & ceo , and ray bowen , chief operating officer , remains unchanged .  commercial support for ews  the commercial support functions for ews will remain with , and be managed by ,  the individual business units . we are creating no incremental overhead in  the creation of ews , and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more  efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews .  to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across  ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units . these  newly defined roles are as follows :  mid and back office operations  ) sally beck will lead mid and back office  operations across ews . these services will become part of enron net works ,  with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey , executive vice  president and chief accounting officer . this alignment creates a coordinated  services organization with it and e - commerce platforms to support the  wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these  services . mid and back office services for all commercial activities will  continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible  for specific commodities and / or geographic locations .  legal  ) mark haedicke will serve in the role of general counsel for ews .  regulatory and government affairs  ) this function will remain organized on a  regional basis . rick shapiro will support all ews businesses operating in  the americas , and mark schroeder , who is based in london , will support all  european and eastern hemisphere operations . rick and mark will also continue  to support all other enron businesses operating in their respective regions  and will continue to report to steve kean , executive vice president and chief  of staff .  public relations  ) this function is also organized primarily on a regional  basis . eric thode will have responsibility for north american activity ,  enron net works , and enron industrial markets . jackie gentle will continue  in her role for enron europe ( including japan and australia ) and john ambler  will have responsibility for activity outside north america and europe as  well as providing support for enron global markets and enron global assets .  these individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship  to mark palmer , vice president of communications .  business analysis and reporting  ) wes colwell will expand his role to cover  ews reporting in addition to his current role in north america .  attached for your review is an organization chart for enron wholesale  services which summarizes the changes described here . as this organization  continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes .  enron global exploration and production  and enron wind  as part of our company - wide initiative to examine our assets and investments  around the world , we are considering a variety of options with respect to  egep and ewc . as a consequence , we are putting these businesses under cliff  baxter  , s direction . jeff sherrick , ceo of egep , and jim noles , ceo of enron  wind , will report to cliff .  corporate staff  we are consolidating the corporate staff functions : human resources ,  government affairs , public relations / communications and administration . in  that regard , cindy olson , executive vice president of human resources and  community relations , will report to steve kean , executive vice president and  chief of staff .  committee structure  in light of the increased leadership opportunities created by enron  , s  growth , the executive committee will be expanded to include more of our  business unit leaders . the primary role of this committee will continue to  be the communication of relevant information across enron  , s businesses and  the coordination of activities across those businesses . we will also be  drawing on this group to lead company - wide initiatives such as the  performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses .  the executive committee membership is shown on the attached list .  we are also forming a new committee  ) the enron corporate policy committee .  this group will be responsible for overall corporate policy , personnel  management policy and corporate strategy . the enron corporate policy  committee membership is also shown on the attached list .  we are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital to  our highest return opportunities . please join us in congratulating and  supporting all of these individuals in their new roles .",0

"" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of  a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of  this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring  error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""  at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron  designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving  of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",0

"Subject: el paso statement on california situation  in case you haven ' t already seen this :  el paso addresses the california energy situation ( february 26 , 2001 )  houston , feb . 26 / prnewswire / - - el paso corporation ( nyse : epg )  reaffirmed today its continuing commitment to work with all parties  involved to help improve california ' s energy situation . "" we are surprised  to see continuing misinformation in the media concerning el paso ' s  involvement in california , "" said norma dunn , senior vice president of  corporate communications and external affairs at el paso corporation . "" we  would like to take this opportunity to clarify the record . "" the  significant increase in electricity demand at a time when available power  supplies are short has caused a sharp climb in the price of power , which  has in turn increased the price of natural gas used to generate  electricity . high natural gas prices are , therefore , an effect rather than  a cause of the power shortage . allegations that natural gas prices were  deliberately manipulated by withholding capacity on the el paso natural gas  pipeline overlook critical facts and are demonstrably untrue . it is not  possible for any holder of capacity on the el paso natural gas pipeline to  cause a significant increase in california gas prices by refusing to use  that capacity . the el paso natural gas pipeline is required by law to post  the availability of any unused capacity on its public bulletin board and is  obligated to sell that capacity for no more than the published tariff rate  found to be just and reasonable by the federal energy regulatory  commission . all capacity held by el paso merchant energy on the el paso  natural gas pipeline has been used or made available for use by others to  serve california and other western markets . allegations that there was a  "" conspiracy "" in 1996 to limit new interstate pipeline capacity into  california are absolutely refuted by facts that no one can challenge . the  facts show that all new pipelines considered during the 1990 s were either  built or were not viable projects because they lacked sufficient customer  support to justify their construction . for example , despite years of  marketing efforts by tenneco , not a single potential customer could be  induced to make the sort of binding commitment required for the proposed  altamont project to proceed . for that reason alone , it was ultimately  dropped . in 1996 , according to estimates , there were between one and two  billion cubic feet per day ( bcf / d ) of excess natural gas transportation  capacity on existing interstate pipelines serving california . indeed , it  was misplaced reliance on the continuing availability of such excess  capacity that prompted the california public utilities commission to  encourage pg & e , socal edison , and socal gas , beginning in 1996 and  continuing into 1998 , to relinquish over 1 . 5 bcf / d of firm transportation  capacity on the el paso natural gas pipeline . processes are now under way  to assess present demand and support for new interstate pipeline capacity  into california , and el paso intends to do its part to help satisfy  whatever needs may be established today . as recently as last year , there  were periods when significant quantities of unused capacity were available  on the el paso natural gas pipeline that were not necessary to meet demands  at that time . notwithstanding its availability , this capacity was not used  by shippers to california to fill in - state natural gas storage facilities  for future use . if california had taken advantage of the opportunity in  2000 to store the same volumes of natural gas that had been stored in 1999 ,  reliance on the spot market would have been reduced and the steep rise in  prices at the california border could have been substantially mitigated or  avoided . it is now widely recognized that the california "" energy crisis ""  was caused by the inability of the supply of power available in california  to keep pace with the state ' s economy and increased demand . a combination  of factors caused a sharp increase in power prices . first , the construction  of new power plants in california is a slow , difficult , and heavily  regulated process . as a result , the growing demand has far outstripped  in - state generating capabilities . second , unfavorable precipitation and  increased out - of - state demand caused some of the hydroelectric power  normally relied on by california to become unavailable . third , increased  demand for power in the western united states drove up prices that  california had to pay to out - of - state generators . fourth , state policies  deregulated wholesale power prices but capped the rates paid by consumers ,  leaving demand unrestrained and preventing utilities from recovering their  costs . fifth , because rate caps prevented utilities from passing increased  costs to consumers , the utilities ' creditworthiness was impaired , causing  supplemental power needed during peak periods to become more difficult and  expensive to purchase . sixth , the early and greater - than - normal use of  peaking units - plants that are designed to only operate under peak demand  conditions - necessitated unscheduled maintenance , rendering them unavailable  at critical times . seventh , during the final months of 2000 , some power  plants were forced to shut down because increased usage exhausted their air  emissions credits . eighth , a warm summer followed by an early onset of cold  weather further drove up demand for power . finally , the increased power  costs in california could have been substantially mitigated through  long - term power contracts and less reliance on the volatile short - term  power market . "" california is currently in a difficult position , but now  has the opportunity to refine its regulatory model and craft a long - term  energy policy , "" said dunn . "" el paso has been one of the largest suppliers  of energy to california for more than 50 years , and we are actively  participating with all parties in california to be a part of a long - term ,  stable solution to california ' s energy needs .

"Subject: update : ffvols  ted ,  an update on the implementation for ffvols :  ( 1 ) in comparing 6 days of historical var calculations  ( with that of the implied ) for agg - gas , we have found that the historical var  calculations are consistently lower over this period , by roughly 17 mm . the  implied volatilities are much higher at this period , anticipating strong  winter prices .  ( 2 ) at this time , the consensus is not to relase the  historical implementation into production , and the official line to traders  will be that the method is still in testing . the historical var is 19 . 2 mm  and the implied is 37 mm for effective date of 09 / 25 .  ( 3 ) further testing is in progress on a hybrid methodology  ( which i mentioned last week , whereby historical vols are scaled by the ratio  of prompt to historical - prompt volatilities ) , to atleast capture some  implied / forward effects . tanya ' s analysis on a fictitious portfolio  indicates higher var numbers , but poorer backtesting in comparison to the  historical approach . this approach serves as an intermediate , and seems  appropriate in periods such as the current one , wherein the historical  numbers might be considerably lower than those of the implied .  ( 4 ) winston will start testing using these hybrid vols , and  if the results are deemed satisfactory , that will be the production  methodology .  of course , we will obtain all var numbers concurrently to serve as different  indicators and beacons of risk . the production number will hopefully be a  sensible compromise of the different methods .  regards  naveen",0

"Subject: dispatch within maharashtra  jim ,  please find attached some slides that show the results of the henwood run  giving dispatch for the dabhol plant within maharashtra . i have also sent  the presentation we made to you to wade . he is to get back on when would be  an appropriate time for him to go over the presentation with me .  vince , stinson and i have placed ourselves on rebecca ' s calender for friday ,  and we will make the complete pitch to her . it would be great if you too  could be present at the meeting . if it is possible , please do let me know .  on the attached slides , please note that :  the slides all assume that there is a 1 part power tariff , mseb liability for  the entire capacity payment is not considered .  the henwood model was with no power flowing out of maharashtra  when variable o & m costs , fixed o though in  some months ( jan ) it goes as high as $ 69 mm . hence , overall , mseb can pay  for the dispatches as shown in the henwood run provided , they are not paying  for the capacity payment for the whole 2184 mw plant .  in conclusion , therefore , mseb has the need for between 1200 to 410 mw on a  seasonal basis . this means that the power remaining to be sold to other  states is the difference between that and 2184 mw .  however , since the demand within maharashtra varies seasonally , it may mean  that we need to market seasonal products to other states , not long term  blocks .  these are our conclusions . we may continue to work some more on the fuel and  hedging side . if you have any more questions for me , please let me know ,  else for now there will not be any new henwood runs .  regards ,  sandeep .",0

( in high speed communication bandwidth scenarios , for example ,  the dimensions could be price , bandwidth size , time for which bandwidth  available , continguity of the allocation , and such . )  2 ) it involves dynamic matching as opposed to "" static "" matching .  3 ) it is multi - lateral .  4 ) it adapts itself dynamically to changing market conditions .  5 ) it allows traders to make important trade - offs , as they do in  traditional markets .  currently , skg is involved in discussions with the heads of trading at  fidelity , putnam investments , lehman bros . , kpmg , meridien research ,  salomon smith barney , jp morgan , state street , banc of america , mckinsey ,  citizens power , and a host of other folks .  we think we have a value - adding service to provide to enron online or any  other enron subsidiary that the skg offering matches and that you deem fit .  skg ' s founders and i will be very happy to provide you or your  representative ( s ) with more details , including a demo of the prototype , in  a meeting . we are therefore hopeful that you will be able to arrange  something appropriate .  thanks very much , jeff ! we look forward to hearing from you .  with warm regards ,  joseph cherian and robert jarrow  cc : professor robert c . merton  joseph a . cherian  associate professor of finance  boston university school of management  595 commonwealth avenue , room 522 h  boston , ma 02215  tel : 617 - 353 - 2679 ( o )  617 - 353 - 6667 ( fax )",0

( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with  market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that  most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them  and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting ,  asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options  valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron ' s  real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate  these problems by imposing a market disciplining .  ( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials ,  credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have  options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the  story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets  enron has been moving into over the last few years .  on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when  you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am  working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be  wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room .  i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss  some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the  room would be very important to me .  as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 ,  may 3 / 4 are good for me .  regards  nalin  at 06 : 56 pm 03 / 22 / 2001 , mack , iris wrote :  > hi ,  >  > as we briefly discussed , i spoke with one of my colleagues ( dr .  > martin lin ) about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some  > time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications , real options ,  > etc .  >  > martin and i are working on various broadband related problems .  >  > we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about  > the following :  > * when you want to come ( the research group has weekly  > catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday ) .  >  > * a description of what you want to talk about with respect  > to telecoms , broadband , etc .  > * who you would like to meet with me - vince kaminski ( our  > boss ) , any other of our colleagues in research , broadband , etc .  > . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . etc .  >  >  >  >  > look forward to hearing from you .  >  > regards ,  > iris",0

( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with  market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that  most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them  and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting ,  asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options  valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron ' s  real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate  these problems by imposing a market disciplining .  ( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials ,  credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have  options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the  story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets  enron has been moving into over the last few years .  on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when  you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am  working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be  wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room .  i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss  some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the  room would be very important to me .  as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 ,  may 3 / 4 are good for me .  regards  nalin  at 06 : 56 pm 03 / 22 / 2001 , mack , iris wrote :  > hi ,  >  > as we briefly discussed , i spoke with one of my colleagues ( dr .  > martin lin ) about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some  > time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications , real options ,  > etc .  >  > martin and i are working on various broadband related problems .  >  > we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about  > the following :  > * when you want to come ( the research group has weekly  > catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday ) .  >  > * a description of what you want to talk about with respect  > to telecoms , broadband , etc .  > * who you would like to meet with me - vince kaminski ( our  > boss ) , any other of our colleagues in research , broadband , etc .  > . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . etc .  >  >  >  >  > look forward to hearing from you .  >  > regards ,  > iris",0

"Subject: proj . x analytics diligence  paul ,  vince and i spent some time thinking about the diligence process for the  trading analytics . there is a limited amount that can be accomplished in a  two day time period . i think a reasonable start would be the following :  1 . obtain an audited history of the trading strategies which have been  implemented in order to verify profitability , and p / l volatility of each .  2 . review needed working capital and risk capital requirements and compare  these to projections for trading income .  3 . review current level of access to electronic markets and verify that a  change of ownership would not have adverse consequences , i . e . are there  guarantees of continued access using the current systems ?  4 . review feasibility of entry into proposed new markets ? it is far from  clear that there will be any synergy with most commodity markets given the  current limited "" electronic "" liquidity .  5 . review , at least qualitatively , the current trading strategies being  used . try to develop some estimate of how fast the profitability of these  strategies will disappear as other ' s implement similar trading models . what  is the trade off between trade quantity and slippage .  6 . review the methodology used to generate new trading strategies which will  be needed to replace the current models as they become unprofitable and  outdated .  7 . try to determine if there will be any value in transfer of trading  technology to enron ' s other markets , given the illiquidity of these markets  as compared to the financial equity markets .  if there were a sufficiently long time horizon for our analysis , we would  probably want to run their system on a test set of data .  let me know if you have other suggestions .  - - stinson",0

"Subject: alex tartakovski  as you may know , we are trying to schedule an interview for alex tartakovski  in houston this week . i am copying everyone involved because i wont be able  to coordinate this tomorrow . we just brought our new daughter home today and  my wife is yelling at me to get out of my office .  i just found out that thursday & friday are bad days for him , so wednesday is  the only day to do it this week . he would come down tuesday night and fly  out wednesday evening . it ' s probably easiest for him to arrange his flight ,  but he will need a hotel and transportation from the airport . i gave him  donna ' s phone number for help . i assume the hyatt would be best . his home  number is 215 - 702 - 3705 and during the day his cellular is 267 - 981 - 5425 .  by way of background , i plan to bring in 3 people from outside the company to  fill in some of the "" vacants "" in my group ' s org chart . the 3 areas of  specialization that are needed to execute the business plan are ( 1 )  coordination of origination , ( 2 ) deal pricing and underwriting , and ( 3 )  modeling and portfolio management . alex is the perfect person for # 3 . he  has the deepest knowledge of probability of anyone i know and is efficient at  building analysis models , which will be a big job in this business because  portfolio management needs to be redefined in real time due to the lumpiness  of insurance contracts and the lack of any historical methods for evaluating  these risks . development of pricing models will be a joint effort between  "" my "" group and the research dept because this will need to draw on the  expertise in research as well as being a realtime activity as new deals are  being structured . i want to encourage joint work between vasant / amitava  and alex because his background and expertise is compatible with research .  over the past 2 years , alex and i spent a lot of time developing new  electricity spot pricing methodology and this is one area where he excels . i  would expect that he would be a valuable resource in research as well , and so  i would like for him to be able to meet with vince is possible . ( this could  possibly be done when vince is in philadelphia next week if there is time -  ( ? ) ) depending on what work needs to be done in the future , i could see him  working both on pricing research and this specific business unit .  i have attached alex ' s resume . i assume he would be manager level , but i ' m  not sure of this .  this doesnt necessarily come across in the resume , but the skills that are  useful to us are :  probability / statistical model development  development of theoretical pricing methodology  excellent computer programming skills  database development and data analysis  he has the best understanding of the nerc reliability data format outside of  mike curley , the nerc data manager .  designed and wrote the code for the pricing model used by ace power products  for deal pricing and porfolio mgmt .  excellent understanding of options pricing methodology and its application to  hedging insurance portfolios .  if you want to get into superconductor trading , he can design the standards .  can beat me at atari battlezone ( as well as being able to navigate a real  tank through a minefield ) .  one objective of this meeting in houston is to make him feel comfortable with  the organization ( with which you did such a good job for me ) and to give him  confidence that he will be able to do state - of - the - art pricing research in  the most innovative company in the world . he is also interviewing for a job  in morgan stanley ' s equity dept .  we will also arrange a meeting with per in ny , but i would like to be in the  office for that , so we can do that next week .  please call me @ 610 - 996 - 2522 if there are any questions . i may not pick up  but i will reply to voicemail promptly . i ' m up 24 hours this week anyway .  thanks ,  - - dave",0

"Subject: new update on ppi model for inflation book - final version  dear all ,  attached is anjam ' s reasoning and final version of the uk ppi pllu model .  the uk inflation book ' s main exposure is to two ppi indexes - the pllu and  the dzcv through year 2010 . both are ppi output indexes with very comparable  baskets . the only significant difference between the two is the presence of  energy in the pllu ( 7 . 6 % ) . the model in use escalates the two indexes by the  same factors . however , with the energy price fluctuations in recent years  different models for the two indexes would reflect better the nature of their  drivers . anjam concentrated on the pllu index first and he will shortly  construct one for the dzcv based on the same methodology , but without the  brent crude curve .  the new model achieves the two main objectives of the ppi curve : it is  significantly more robust and stable than the existing one , and it is  considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients . this will result in us  having more confidence in our monthly p & l as well as less fluctuations .  best regards ,  martina  x 34327  anjam ahmad  10 / 03 / 2000 11 : 59  to : martina angelova / lon / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : new update on ppi model for inflation book  dear all ,  i followed up on the suggestions of happening babe at the conference call as  follows : -  1 ) use less data  unfortunately , kicking out only 1990 makes the overall equation a lot less  robust , in fact dramatically so , and so eliminates the possibility of using  less data . the model tested was the rpi ( month + 15 ) ppi pre - empts the moves in rpi by about 8 months . the  magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced . this shows that if we had  more detail in our rpi forward curve , then the ppi model would reflect those  peaks and humps adequately .  conclusion  i therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates rpi , rpi [ t + 15 ]  and deviations of brent crude from long - term average . the new model is  plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old ppi which is  depicted in blue .  please note that all this analysis only applies to pllu , and that a separate  study will be needed for the dzcv ppi index .  regards ,  anjam  x 35383  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by anjam ahmad / lon / ect on 09 / 03 / 2000 16 : 52  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  anjam ahmad  08 / 03 / 2000 14 : 03  to : martina angelova / lon / ect @ ect , harry arora / hou / ect @ ect , maureen  raymond / hou / ect @ ect , zimin lu / hou / ect @ ect , farouk lalji / hou / ect @ ect  cc : trena mcfarland / lon / ect @ ect , dale surbey / lon / ect @ ect , stinson  gibner / hou / ect @ ect , vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , leandro  ibasco / corp / enron @ enron  subject : update on ppi model for inflation book  dear all ,  we thought it might be useful to incorporate brent crude as an explanatory  variable for ppi ; it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from the  long - term average of $ 18 . 80 was the best form of the variable to use ( for  predictions the brent forward curve produced by the global products group is  used ) . the three new equations developed were : -  pllu ( t ) = a . rpi ( t ) + b . rpi ( t + n ) + c . ( datedbrentcrude - 18 . 8 ) + constant ,  where n is 14 , 15 or 16  [ reddish curves ]  r - squared approx 0 . 49  f - stat approx 32  the chart below shows what our projected pllu curve would be given this  equation , and also the three best relations from before which were based upon  current and future rpi :  pllu ( t ) = a . rpi ( t ) + b . rpi ( t + n ) + constant , where n is 14 , 15 or 16  [ greenish curves ]  r - squared approx 0 . 47  f - stat approx 45  comparison of models  as you can see , the two equations differ in the very short - term and very  long - term ; the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to short - term  predictions of 3 . 0 % to 3 . 2 % over the next six months . the greenish curves  predict pllu in the range of 2 . 5 % to 2 . 8 % over the next six months .  the curves are then very similar until 2009 , when the models including crude  break - away to the upside , relative to the falling rpi curve . the model based  purely on rpi hugs the rpi curve much more closely in the longer term . this  is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009  ( which we don ' t ) .  suggestion  what could be useful now is a differently - specified model designed to  forecast only the next 3 months , using auto - regressive or auto - regressive  error terms . this model would be far more accurate in the near - term , and we  could include this information onto the front of this long - term model . this  may be useful , despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time  buckets .  back - testing  all the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data  sample used ( based mainly on 1990 s "" new paradigm "" economy ) .  hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele - conference ;  your ideas on this would be appreciated .  regards ,  anjam  x 35383",0

"Subject: a & a math majors  vince ,  thank you so much for meeting with me friday morning about the research  group .  after leaving your office , i remembered an issue i have had with the analyst  & associate program that might be of interest to you .  during a texas a & m recruiting meeting , i learned that we have expanded our  list of majors to include computer science . i wondered why math majors were  not mentioned , and was told that there was not a business need for math  majors . like liberal arts majors , they said math majors were only considered  on a person by person basis . in my opinion , math majors have many of the  same skills as finance majors , and can easily adjust to accounting rotations  as well ( i did last summer , and finance majors in the program are forced to  every year . ) i think that enron is missing out on many qualified candidates  by limiting their recruitment effort .  at texas a & m the career center asks companies for a list of majors they are  targeting , and only allows those majors to sign up for interviews through the  career center . i sent my resume to enron and asked to be included in the  interview process on campus . however , many other math majors had not heard  of enron or the other companies , and assumed that there was no place for a  math major at a company like enron . many math majors want to continue their  education , become teachers , or work for an actuarial firm . however , many  are undecided . we are constantly told of the many business possibilities  available to math majors by our teachers and staff , but many undergraduates  are still not sure exactly what math majors can contribute in a business  environment . by not mentioning math majors to the career center ( a very  simple and inexpensive step ) , enron is losing out on a very talented pool of  people . while it would be nice to get the math majors that knew about enron  already , had thoroughly researched all companies and determined that math  majors would fit perfectly , and went the extra step to send enron their  resume outside the career center system , there are many qualified students  who do not do this , and opt for other companies who did mention math majors .  i called a manager in the a & a program to suggest that we consider at least  mentioning math majors to the career centers . i realize that it may cost  more to actively pursue them , talk to teachers , and attend math society  events . however , i told her that including them at the career center would  be very inexpensive for enron . she reiterated that they saw no business need  for math majors , and that if more upper level people began requesting them ,  it would be considered . i searched for "" mathematics "" on the enron job  website , and had a surprising number of results . i know that your group  could use math majors as well . however , this still may be too small a number  to merit a focus from the a & a recruiting department . i just wanted to bring  it to your attention in case it was something that you felt should be changed .  thanks ,  heather johnson  x 53240",0

"Subject: re : steve leppard  dale ,  my recommendation is to make steve the head of the research unit in london .  we were talking originally about september but i think we should accelerate  this process .  of course , anjam will be very unhappy about it , but we cannot manage around  him  any longer .  i think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase .  i would like to offer him a significant increase that  goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility .  a salary increase will also bring him closer to the market .  we see the market for technical people going through the roof in  practically every location  where we operate .  a contract is not a good solution in my view . it creates a sense of false  security for  both an employee and the company .  i shall send a message to john sherriff with my recommendation . i shall cc  you .  i would appreciate if you could bring it up with john as well .  vince  dale surbey  07 / 11 / 2000 10 : 23 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : steve leppard  hi vince ,  hr is working on a mid - year salary review for london people that have a  noticeable gap between their compensation at enron and what we would have to  pay in the market for a replacement . they highlighted steve as someone with  a potential gap - particularly in light of what we ' re seeing in our quant  recruiting effort for credit trading and research .  i ' d like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep steve happy and  keep him at enron . there are several things i see we can do :  1 ) give him a mid - year pay increase to move him closer to market . i ' m not  sure this is the best way to go , especially if we only offer him a token  salary increase .  2 ) offer him more responsibility : what are your thoughts on timing for  making steve the official head of the london research team ? with my move to  ebs , should we accelerate this ? i think this is good way to keep him happy  and motivated , and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at  year - end ( as part of the regular process ) that takes into account his greater  responsibility .  3 ) we have some people that we ' re trying to get under long - term ( 3 - yr )  contract with a 12 - month notice clause . obviously anyone signing one of  these will want significant up - front compensation for being handcuffed .  we ' ve not had a lot of success with these here in london , and i would prefer  to keep steve happy so he wants to stay with enron rather than contractually  binding him to the job .  i ' d value your thoughts on this .  thanks ,  dale",0

"Subject: friday brown bag on derivative pricing  dear everyone ,  we understand the as members of enron research group , all of us are working  on very interesting projects , some of which are ground - breaking , and we all  keep a very keen mind on any development of new technology . we also find  out , through our own experience , that at this age of information explosion ,  it becomes more and more difficult to have enough time and energy to keep  abreast with most of the exciting stuff taking place in this department , let  alone in the industry . it is also our personal experience that many a  project we are working on has partially been attempted by other members of  this group .  as a remedy , we propose that the research group start an informal brown bag  lunch group meeting , once every two weeks on friday , for about 50 minutes .  it is hoped that it will provide a forum for us to facilitate with new  technology and development , as well as with each other  , s work , so that we do  not have to reinvent the wheels .  we envision the following : in this meeting ( or seminar ) , each one of us will  take turns to make presentations to the group . the topics could range from  theoretical consideration to practical implementation , be it option pricing ,  process modelling , insurance issue , or monte carlo simulation , or anything  one finds fascinating . the presentation material could be papers you have  been reading recently , projects you are working on , some problem that  bothers you , or an idea that is fascinating . you choose your own  presentation style . it could be  everything - you - always - wanted - to - know - but - were - afraid - to - ask , hand waving  style , or it can involve nitty - gritty , detailed derivations , anyway a style  that suits you and the topic . or it can simply be a dry - run for your  presentation at the next risk conference . zimin and alex will take upon the  responsibility of organizing the seminar .  we hope the seminar will be up and running in two - three weeks . for that  purpose your support will be greatly appreciated . please let either zimin or  alex know if you are interested in giving a presentation to the group and  provide a tentative schedule . surely the rest of the group will be happy to  hear your presentation .  we encourage everyone to participate this brown bag meeting , either to give a  talk or just sit in .  zimin lu  alex huang",0
"Subject: sap timesheets  hello everyone :  thanks to krishna we have come up with a plan that i believe is going to  save everyone some time . we have created an excel spreadsheet , with  the time sheet form , and there is a tab for each of you , in alphabetical  order  by first name across the bottom of the spreadsheet .  the spreadsheet is saved in o : \ research \ common \ sap timesheets \ mmm - dd .  ( mmm = month and dd = 15 th or end of the month time period - i . e . , this time  period is 7 / 16 - 7 / 31 / 00 ) . the regular 8 hour days have already been entered  for each of you . therefore , if you have no exceptions you just need to type  in  your name in the bottom right corner by the place marked ( emp sign ) , and save  it .  if you do have exception time , simply open that particular pay period and  show the exception time ( off - duty , vacation , overtime , sick time , jury time ,  family  time , etc . ) that you may have had during that pay period . some of the codes  have already been entered for you , the rest are listed at the bottom of the  spreadsheet and just change the ones that are already there for whatever  applies .  if you are an exempt employee you need only show your off - duty time  or exception time . if you are non - exempt you must show all hours worked  and if you have overtime , you must add that to the 8 hours regular time .  there is no code for non - exempt overtime .  this should make it much easier for everyone . however , i will need you to  fill out this timesheet form by the 13 th and 29 th of each month . i will  try and remind you by email the day before .  i would still appreciate your emailing me of any vacation , hod day , or any  other  off - duty that you know about before hand , that way if you are out of pocket  for any  reason and cannot fill in one of the forms , i will be able to fill in your  timesheet for you .  if you have any questions or suggestions , please let me know .  thanks !  shirley",0

"Subject: re : var  vince  thanks for the update - especially your point 3 which echoes our own discussion yesterday : i want to clarify responsibilities for maintenance and administration of var .  we need transparency around the process so that mapping decisions , for example , are easily made , supported and reviewed .  it became clear after last friday ' s events , that we are in an awkward paradigm with respect to how we handle var here , particularly at "" pressure points "" .  i am putting together the scope of a "" general overhaul "" of the var process , including method and administration , to which i hope we would all buy in , so be assured of our co - operation .  dp  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : kaminski , vince  sent : wednesday , april 11 , 2001 2 : 49 pm  to : port , david  cc : lavorato , john ; kaminski , vince ; tamarchenko , tanya  subject : var  david ,  during today ' s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues  related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations .  mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system :  we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds  of available cpu memory . also , in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor  and it ' s difficult to model the price curves independently : we solve the problem by mapping  them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves .  we have agreed on the following :  1 . winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can increase the number  of forward price curves that are simulated as basic ( core ) curves . he will investigate the impact of a larger  number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run .  2 . the curves associated with the biggest 10 - 20 positions in each commodity should be  modeled as core curves ( i . e . no mapping into other locations ) . it makes sense to monitor  the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates .  3 . the results of an automated clustering ( mapping ) procedures should be systematically  monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions .  this responsibility should be vested with one person ( right now the responsibility is  dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody  is responsible ) . research can allocate one person to this task ;  cooperation of trading and rac will be critical .  vince",0

"Subject: a basic idea of price - offer matching clauses  vince -  here is the basic idea i was alluding to :  suppose a car dealer promised to "" match any advertised price . "" then his  competitor would feel the need to respond in kind . and so on , until all  dealers advertised they would "" match any advertised price . "" now , consider one  of these dealer ' s decision to perhaps lower his prices . if he does so ,  everyone will immediately match his price , so his market share will remain  unchanged , at whatever it was before , but his revenues ( and all other dealers  as well ) would be lowered by the amount of his price reduction . so , the  dealer rationally decides not to lower his prices to try to sell more cars .  now , suppose a limited partnership , where the partners contract to "" control ""  who they are in business with , by putting a "" right of first refusal "" clause  into the partnership ' s papers , whereby any partner wishing to sell his  interests must offer the remaining partners the right to match any offer the  partner received from outside for his shares . now , suppose you are an  outsider , considering doing your due diligence in the thought you might want  to buy into the partnership . you know if your offer is a "" good "" one from your  perspective , offering you the prospects of a fair rate of return , the  existing partners will match it , and you will get nothing in the deal but you  will have paid , from your own pocket , for your due diligence . conversely , if  you offer too much for the shares , then the other partners will not match  your offer and you will then realize you overpaid . in neither case can you  credibly assume you know more about the business than do the current  partners . so , you ( basically ) don ' t make an offer . so , a partner ' s shares  are seriously devalued by his partners having the right to match any offers  he receives for them . the "" right of first refusal "" clause precludes  economically efficient rebalancing of portfolios by rendering the shares  ( essentially ) illiquid .  clayton",0

"Subject: re : london research prc  dale ,  thanks for the update . i fully concur with all the rankings .  it seems things are going well with the research group in  london and this is , to a very large extent , your contribution .  i think that anjam has improved a lot . i don ' t think , however ,  that he can run the group in the future . steve emerged as a natural  leader and has overwhelming support in the organization .  vince  dale surbey  06 / 15 / 2000 02 : 28 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : london research prc  vince ,  we had the prc preranking for rac and research in london yesterday . here ' s  how everyone came out :  steven - superior : no controversy here . steve received consistently strong  feedback ( ranked as either superior or excellent in all categories ) . the  only rough spot was teamwork , arising from the friction between anjam and  himself .  anjam - excellent : anjam received rankings of superiors or excellents in all  categories . several reviewers commented that anjam ' s performance in the  areas of producing results in a timely manner and communication have  improved . i felt the overall ranking of excellent was justified based on  this feedback , even though in terms of leadership i don ' t rate him high  enough to run the group here .  stinsen provided the most insightful comment on anjam ' s performance :  "" technically superior but lets his quest for a leadership position detract  from his overall performance "" .  on a related topic , anjam has been taking random days off , typically on short  notice , so i suspect he ' s interviewing for a new job . given his inability to  work with steven ( especially in the future when stephen heads the group ) ,  this may be the best long - term solution . any thoughts ?  ben - superior : another non - controversial ranking . ben received  consistently high marks from all the groups he supports , especially in the  area of non - technical skills .  i nominated ben for promotion to senior specialist . even though he was  promoted at year end , he ' s taken on a lot of responsibility training kirstee  and helping manage the other quant resources in brian ' s group . also , since  kirstee was hired in at the same level as ben , a mid - year promotion is  appropriate since he ' s effectively her supervisor .  kirstee - strong : only limited feedback in the 2 months she ' s been here .  high marks for technical / quantitative , strong in the "" soft "" skills . i think  the strong rating is the right message for early in the game - gives her a  target for improvement for the rest of the year .  - dale",0

( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with  market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that  most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them  and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting ,  asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options  valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron ' s  real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate  these problems by imposing a market disciplining .  ( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials ,  credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have  options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the  story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets  enron has been moving into over the last few years .  on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when  you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am  working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be  wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room .  i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss  some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the  room would be very important to me .  as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 ,  may 3 / 4 are good for me .  regards  nalin  at 06 : 56 pm 03 / 22 / 2001 , mack , iris wrote :  > hi ,  >  > as we briefly discussed , i spoke with one of my colleagues ( dr .  > martin lin ) about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some  > time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications , real options ,  > etc .  >  > martin and i are working on various broadband related problems .  >  > we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about  > the following :  > * when you want to come ( the research group has weekly  > catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday ) .  >  > * a description of what you want to talk about with respect  > to telecoms , broadband , etc .  > * who you would like to meet with me - vince kaminski ( our  > boss ) , any other of our colleagues in research , broadband , etc .  > . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . etc .  >  >  >  >  > look forward to hearing from you .  >  > regards ,  > iris",0

"Subject: re : henwood query  hi karolina ,  yes , it might be more productive to talk on the phone . given our time  difference , why don ' t we plan on tomorrow ( friday ) 8 : 00 am pdt , 4 : 00 pm bdt ? my  number in the states is 503 - 464 - 8430 . give me your number , too , so that i can  call back if i get hung up in a meeting or something .  the situation is complicated by the fact that the marginal cost is set by the  capacity increment of a plant that is on the margin in a particular hour , but  in constructing the stack , increments of a plant may be scattered throughout  the stack , based on their respective incremental heat rates . ( this is why  increment heat rates must be strictly increasing in this model . ) results for  the capacity increments , however , are not available as output ; only each  plant ' s aggregate values are reported .  i had to construct the stack for a particular hour to answer question about a  homer city , ny plant we were studying a few years ago . attached is the sql  query you can import into ms access to do the same thing for you ( making  appropriate modifications to the year , hour , etc . ) unfortunately , no henwood  documentation on the output variables existed when i created this query , so i  can not really tell you what they represent anymore . an acquaintance of mine  at entergy and i were lobbying to get henwood to provide some documentation ,  so it may be available now .  let ' s talk and maybe we can help you out ,  michael  > > > karolina potter / lon / ect @ enron 08 / 24 / 00 07 : 08 am > > >  michael ,  i am an analyst in paul mead ' s continental power trading group in london . i am  currently working on the project , which requires the use of emss , and  experience some difficulties interpreting the output results . steven leppard  from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and  consequently the person to contact in case of problems .  i have been running simulations for the dutch market and was asked to provide  the traders with some front - end screen graphs in order to interpret the  numerical results . one of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack and  system ' s marginal cost , as we only run cost based scenarios . to sort each  station ' s hourly generation i need its marginal cost . to my knowledge though ,  marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit ( transarea  marginal units query , marg _ cost unit ) . therefore i was sorting the stations  according to the cost which i calculated based on the outputs from station  detail by hour query . the calculation was as follows :  for each hour , for each generating station :  "" marginal cost "" [ o / mwh ] = ( generation _ cost [ oo 00 ] * 1000 ) / generation [ mwh ] -  vom _ cost [ o / mwh ]  this i thought would include fuel cost and start up costs . however , a marginal  station which i get on the stack as a result of the above calculation is not a  station given in marginal station field in transarea marginal units query . i  have also looked into transarea _ data _ hr table and transarea _ data table but non  of the costs there match my results .  do you happen to know what formula is used to determine marg _ cost and which  outputs i should be using to obtain the right results ?  it might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone . in this case  could you please send me your direct telephone number . i am struggling  understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much .  regards  karolina",0

"Subject: latest draft  don ,  attached is my latest effort . it entailed fairly drastic "" restructuring  and reorganization "" of the earlier draft . my revision effort has been  directed at improving the focus of the paper . the new story is the following :  1 . enron was formed as a regulated gas pipeline company in the mid - eighties .  2 . economic and competitive conditions conspired to force a dramatic  reorganization of the company almost immediately . the result was the  creation of a new , unregulated energy trading operation . the strategy of  the new unit was to capitalize on business opportunities in the  deregulation of markets that was occuring at the time ( mid - eighties until  now ) .  3 . the business model adopted for the new unregulated business was that of  a "" gas bank "" . the analogy to a commercial bank posed a very difficult  problem to enron ' s management in that there was no source of liquidity to  the market from a central bank authority . as a consequence enron had to  develop its own very elaborate risk management procedures .  4 . another consequence of the new business model was that it required a  different set of employee skills and talents . specifically , it required  were bright , energetic and innovative individuals capable of identifying  entrepreneurial opportunities and starting new businesses . furthermore , a  new , flatter organizational structure entailing decentralized decision  making was required to facilitate quick response to changing market  conditions . to monitor and manage this new "" empowered "" labor force  required that the firm develop new personnel policies and procedures .  5 . three primary tools of personnel management were adopted : ( i ) measure  performance semi - annually , ( ii ) tie compensation closely to performance ,  and ( iii ) allow personnel free movement within enron to seek out the best  opportunities .  6 . other attributes of the enron model include consideration for asset  optionality , recognition of the value of networks in adding value to  trading platforms , and the use of mark - to - market accounting for business  transactions as a means of ensuring transparency and promoting prompt actions .  if my "" story line "" sounds better than the draft i have attached its because  its the last thing i ' ve written . at any rate i look forward to hearing  your comments and to getting this wrapped up .  thanks and i look forward to seeing you in february .  john  - enron _ paper _ 1 _ 26 _ 01 . doc  john d . martin  carr p . collins chair in finance  finance department  baylor university  po box 98004  waco , tx 76798  254 - 710 - 4473 ( office )  254 - 710 - 1092 ( fax )  j _ martin @ baylor . edu  web : http : / / hsb . baylor . edu / html / martinj / home . html",0

"Subject: just fyi  vince ,  please see below some of the ideas being bounced , fyi . please keep this  confidential .  the unused capacity in maharashtra should be dispatched on a merchant basis ,  on behalf of mseb to any customers outside mseb ' s current purview . i would  like us to look at the whole issue as one of mseb ' s poor credit , and hence (  as jeff pointed out on the call ) , one where we need to identify all deep  pockets in and out of maharashtra .  secondly , there is ( as shubh and i had pointed out ) the ability to evacuate  about 700 - 1000 mw to customers other than mseb . the challege is - at what  price , and in coordination with which agencies . as always , in india your  greatest challenge will be in dealing with govt . agencies .  another point to consider is that in - all we have about 5 - 7 customers  identified . will all the customers we have earmarked bite ? ? ? this is the  reason why systems need to be set up with a bulletin board on pricing 10 - 15  day power on the screens of the different sebs we can connect up with . this  also substantially gets around the credit quality issue , as this would be an  arrangement akin to cash - and - carry . i see a lot of hope for such a  strategy . i do not see much hope for a strategy of selling blocks of power  to either ntpc or ptc . i would agree however , that we not put all our eggs  in one basket , and hence you could designate a team to look into the ntpc  sale issue inparallel .  in order to set up the trading sytems , however , we need to start by the end  of ql 2001 , and just start doing small deals where we break even , simply to  test the waters and introduce liquidity into the market .  hand - in - hand with this we need a fuel risk management strategy , as i have  been pushing for . for this to happen , we need to get the special import  licence reinstated . if that is not possible , we need to lobby with the  highest authorities within govt . and rbi to allow for hedging , irrespective  of whether we have an sil . the discussions being held with ioc are therefore  very important in this regard , and i am going to get anshuman and mukesh  involved with the same .  finally , i do not see much hope for your strategy of asking ene management  for $ 75 million to build transmission lines in a country where the regulatory  framework on transmission access is even less defined and understood than the  generation side of the equation . i would refrain from stating this in any  senior management forum until we are able to clearly demonstrate the  cost - benefit of this . i have some ideas on that side which i need to develop  further .  regards ,  sandeep .",0

"Subject: possible rtp conference  dear mr . kaminski :  thank you for talking with me about a possible rtp conference . i would  like to include some discussions of what has been learned in other industries .  as i indicated , frank wolak suggested that i contact you . in discussing  power markets with frank and other colleagues at stanford and epri , it  seems quite evident that real - time pricing for retail customers is the  "" forgotten resource "" in more efficient power markets . there seems to be a  lot of confusion about what rtp means and it also seems that many  researchers need to address some practical but important problems . i was  asked whether a group like stanford ' s emf might explore this topic and give  it the visibility that would have it considered more seriously by  policymakers .  frank thought that you might be someone who could help me structure a  useful approach and who might also see whether enron could become a major  sponsor . i was hoping that this issue was sufficiently important to enron  that the company might consider providing $ 25 , 000 . as you may appreciate ,  it requires some thought and effort to make sure that the product of the  conference is widely circulated among key government groups .  i would be very interested in hearing from you if you can provide ideas and  recommendations for people ( perhaps yourself or a colleague ) to  participate . i would also appreciate any consideration by enron of  providing funding for this effort .  thank you ,  hill huntington  - retail notes . rtf  hillard g . huntington  emf - an international forum on  energy and environmental markets voice : ( 650 ) 723 - 1050  408 terman center fax : ( 650 ) 725 - 5362  stanford university email : hillh @ stanford . edu  stanford , ca 94305 - 4026  emf website : http : / / www . stanford . edu / group / emf /",0

"Subject: stephen bennett  stephen bennett , professional meteorologist , was hired into the research  group in september of this year as a specialist based on salary alignment  criteria . in retrospect , and upon review , he should have been hired on as a  senior specialist .  after coming on board . it rapidly became apparent that stephen was clearly an  "" under hire . "" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of  a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of  this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring  error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""  at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron  designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving  of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",0

"Subject: corrected : new update on ppi model for inflation book  dear all ,  i followed up on the suggestions at the conference call as follows : -  1 ) use less data  unfortunately , kicking out only 1990 makes the overall equation a lot less  robust , in fact dramatically so , and so eliminates the possibility of using  less data . the model tested was the rpi ( month + 15 ) ppi pre - empts the moves in rpi by about 8 months . the  magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced . this shows that if we had  more detail in our rpi forward curve , then the ppi model would reflect those  peaks and humps adequately .  conclusion  i therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates rpi , rpi [ t + 15 ]  and deviations of brent crude from long - term average . the new model is  plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old ppi which is  depicted in blue .  the new model achieves the two main objectives of the ppi curve : it is  significantly more robust and stable than the existing one , and it is  considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients , which results in us  having more confidence in our monthly p it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from the  long - term average of $ 18 . 80 was the best form of the variable to use ( for  predictions the brent forward curve produced by the global products group is  used ) . the three new equations developed were : -  pllu ( t ) = a . rpi ( t ) + b . rpi ( t + n ) + c . ( datedbrentcrude - 18 . 8 ) + constant ,  where n is 14 , 15 or 16  [ reddish curves ]  r - squared approx 0 . 49  f - stat approx 32  the chart below shows what our projected pllu curve would be given this  equation , and also the three best relations from before which were based upon  current and future rpi :  pllu ( t ) = a . rpi ( t ) + b . rpi ( t + n ) + constant , where n is 14 , 15 or 16  [ greenish curves ]  r - squared approx 0 . 47  f - stat approx 45  comparison of models  as you can see , the two equations differ in the very short - term and very  long - term ; the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to short - term  predictions of 3 . 0 % to 3 . 2 % over the next six months . the greenish curves  predict pllu in the range of 2 . 5 % to 2 . 8 % over the next six months .  the curves are then very similar until 2009 , when the models including crude  break - away to the upside , relative to the falling rpi curve . the model based  purely on rpi hugs the rpi curve much more closely in the longer term . this  is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009  ( which we don ' t ) .  suggestion  what could be useful now is a differently - specified model designed to  forecast only the next 3 months , using auto - regressive or auto - regressive  error terms . this model would be far more accurate in the near - term , and we  could include this information onto the front of this long - term model . this  may be useful , despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time  buckets .  back - testing  all the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data  sample used ( based mainly on 1990 s "" new paradigm "" economy ) .  hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele - conference ;  your ideas on this would be appreciated .  regards ,  anjam  x 35383",0

( they can be by regional wholesale prices as well . ) ege establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years .  ege is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data . ege is now updated for the 4 th quarter 2000 ( through december 31 , 2000 ) . ege lst quarter 2000 ( through march 31 , 2001 ) will be available approximately june 15 , 2001 .  ege also compares and ranks generating units ' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility ( as well as other regional generators ) . some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half - load level for lengthy time periods ( without an apparent reliability basis ) , splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units .  other ege supporting data :  i . planned maintenance schedule ( where indicated ) ;  j . actual maximum generating capacity ;  k . actual minimum generating capacity ( actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government - reported values ) ;  l . average heat rate in the full - load range ; and  m . average heat rate in the three - quarter - load range .  with respect to a generating units ' average heat rate in the half - load , three - quarter - load and full - load ranges , it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region . it can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities , and changes in recent years in these parameters .  the real - world example of allegheny energy  allegheny energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of ege . in the 4 th quarter 2000 , for instance , one high - cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning ( 52 times ) and committed for the whole day ( in all but two cases ) . arguably , there are power products that could substitute for this routine ( in part at least ) at a profit to the seller of the product and allegheny energy .  another high - cost allegheny energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn ( nine times ) and committed for most of the coming week . at another plant , two high - cost units were operated too often in the expensive half - load range ( some 550 hours ) and three - quarter - load range ( another 400 to 600 hours ) ; they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels . again , there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to allegheny energy .  offering of energy leader consulting ( elc )  ege is a procedure , not a software package or data base . elc believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities .  elc transfers its "" knowledge "" about the ege procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight - forward four - step process :  1 . enron would select one to three target utilities .  2 . elc would perform the ege procedure on the target utilities .  3 . employing this real - world analysis as a pedagogic tool , elc , in a one - day seminar with enron personnel , would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future ( without the assistance of elc ) .  4 . optionally , elc would provide ege supporting data , quarterly , to enron .  the basic ege supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program ( virtually all fossil fuel units ) . parameters that are incorporated , and the data set format , will be specified upon request . custom modifications will be considered .  steven a . mitnick  chief executive officer  energy leader consulting  4807 41 st street , nw  washington , dc 20016  ( 202 ) 997 - 0924 voice  ( 202 ) 537 - 0906 fax  smitnick @ energyleader . com",0

"Subject: power trading  hi folks :  very glad to hear about the new developments . just to recap what we  discussed this morning about different things you need to look into to set up  trading operations and the contacts :  1 . licence to trade : regulatory people : i guess you know about this part  better than me .  2 . trading & risk mgmt : global risk mgmt oversight : john sherrif in london  has the overall responsibility outside western hemisphere . research group can  help with the structuring models used for trading .  3 . risk conrols : before trading group is operational , it needs to get the  authorization from the board of directors of enron along with total position  limits and possibly value @ risk limits . these limits are typically by  commodity type and by region . risk assessment & control ( rac ) under rick buy  performs the internal control function ensuring that the businesses adhere to  these trading limits . ted murphy is the vp in rac overseeing the trading  operations . the value @ risk models come from the research group , but  day - to - day monitoring of the numbers is done by ted ' s group .  4 . credit risk : a credit reserve number is computed for each deal ( again , the  models are created by research ) and is transferred to the credit group under  bill bradford ( also in rac ) . this is basically like buying insurance from the  corp . , so that if there is a couterparty default , the loss is covered by the  reserve pool of the credit dept .  5 . legal : the name i was given is alan aronowitz for legal help .  6 . back office : initially can survive with excel spreadsheets . you should  contact the it though when the plans finalize to talk about systems .  australia is the most recent place where we set up the trading operations .  you can talk to paul quilky , the trader there to talk about these issues  ( mention to him that grant masson in research gave his name ) .  barry pierce in london was incharge of back office at the begin there .  i can coordinate for talking with people next week . give me a call monday if  possible . i hadn ' t the time to search for the presentation stuff today . will  do it next week .  krishna .",0

is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison  investment ?  * * this is a good point . i was thinking in terms of the average variance ,  but this may not be correct . actually , we know that this is just an  approximation and we need to think about whether or not it is a good  approximation . typically , firms tend to ignore issues relating to the  duration of their project cash flows when they determine discount rate ,  which clearly does not make sense . this requires some additional thought . * *  4 . finally , our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the  investment and also the risk capital . setting risk capital to zero , this  model closely resembles the intuitive present value criterion and  endogenously determines the discount rate .  * * this is correct . my goal was to come up with something that was closely  related to what you are already doing but which gives you some insight into  how to define risk capital and the appropriate discount rate . there are a  number of ways that we can refine and improve this procedure . what we need  to first consider is whether or not the basic approach makes sense for the  kind of projects that you are evaluating . * *  gas field case  to facilitate your thinking , we are providing a gas field example below .  we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field . a profile of  expected production and variance of the production per year is available  from the engineers at the beginning . production will be autocorrelated , as  the profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being  more or less than the estimated reserves . we assume the life of the field  to be 10 years with no salvage value . there are fixed and variable  operating costs . it might be useful for you to think about applying the  framework to this problem .  * * this problem is probably pretty straightforward because it is unlikely  that the cash flows will be negative once the gas field is producing .  hence , there is no need to be concerned about risk capital ( other than the  x million dollars to buy and develop the property ) . to value the property  assuming all - equity financing we calculate the value process of the  developed project and compare its volatility to a comparison investment  whose value process is observable ( e . g . , a traded mlp ) . the risk - adjusted  return of the comparison investment would then be used to discount the cash  flows of the gas field .  please note that this procedure requires relatively strong assumptions and  calculating the risk - adjusted return on the comparison investment is not  necessarily straightforward . * *  let me know when you would like to discuss this .  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  on another topic , is it possible for you to give me information about one  case where enron bought or sold a base load power plant , where the  purchaser financed the transaction with non - recourse debt . we would like  the following information :  1 . the value of the power plant ( or purchase price )  2 . the amount of debt financing and the terms of the debt contract .  3 . some information about the pricing of gas - power swaps and options .  about a year ago i gave vince a paper which develops a pricing model for  project debt . i don ' t think he thought that it could be implemented on the  type of projects that enron finances . however , my coauthors would like to  try applying the model for one case study .  let me know when you want to discuss these issues .  thanks ,  sheridan  sheridan titman  department of finance  college of business administration  university of texas  austin , texas 78712 - 1179  512 - 232 - 2787 ( phone )  512 - 471 - 5073 ( fax )  titman @ mail . utexas . edu",0

'  state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz  the economic times , friday apr 27 2001  dpc board empowers md to cancel mseb contract  the enron power project crisis on thursday deepened with the board of dabhol  power company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to the  maharashtra state electricity board even while international lenders to the  project asked enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed with the  mseb .  the decision to authorise managing director neil mcgregor to issue "" notice of  termination on the contract to sell 740 mw of power "" was taken after the  board prevented mseb from voting on the ground that it was an interested  party . the decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single  opposition vote was cast by idbi , sources said .  according to reports , financial institutions such as anz investment bank ,  credit suisse first boston , citibank , abn - amro and the state bank of india  have on wednesday advised enron against terminating its ppa with mseb . mseb  chairman vinay bansal , who with two other directors attended the meeting on  wednesday representing maharashtra  , s 15 per cent stake in the near $ 3 - billion  project , said : "" the indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if  enron broke the contract . "" while bansal declined comment on the board  decision , the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to  holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were  possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the  state . ( pti )  the economic times , friday apr 27 2001  mseb pays rs 134 cr under ' protest ' to dpc  despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head ,  maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of  rs 134 crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to  dabhol . "" we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself , but dpc  officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh "" , a senior  mseb official said . "" we have disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore and it would  be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india  managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members "" , mseb sources  said .  last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that  it would not accept "" protest payments "" anymore . cline had said the energy  major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in  fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the  "" purported protest or reservation "" . mseb had paid a rs 113 . 5 crore february  bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international  lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the  multinational ' s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state  government . ( pti )  business standard , friday , april 27 , 001  enron india md authorised to terminate ppa  the board of the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) , at its meeting in  london on wednesday , authorised the managing director of enron india to issue  a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra  state electricity board and the state government .  & the board has authorised  wade cline to serve the termination notice . however , this does not mean that  the termination notice will be served immediately . it is only an enabling  provision and will be used only if the situation arises ,  8 a state government  source told business standard from london . he said dpc was under pressure  from its lenders .  the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue . the hardening of  the board  , s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc ' s lenders , who  had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice .  the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not  be served at this stage . serving of the notice requires a nod from the  lenders , who have an exposure of about $ 2 billion in the project . sources  said given the lenders ' strong opposition to termination of the contract , the  enron board ' s "" enabling resolution "" did not have much significance beyond  conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio . the  maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of  crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice . the state government is to  nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract .  enron holds 65 per cent in dpc , while us - based ge and bechtel hold 10 per  cent each . the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose  vehicle , maharashtra power development corporation . the mseb representatives  were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party .  the idbi representative protested against the board ' s decision . the meeting  was attended by state energy secretary vm lal . the meeting was held against  the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills .  after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill , dpc  invoked the state government ' s guarantee and then the union government ' s  counter guarantee . when payment of the rs 127 - crore january bill became  overdue , dpc again invoked the state government ' s guarantee . mseb retaliated  on january 28 , 2001 by slapping a rs 401 - crore penalty for non - supply of  electricity at adequate levels . it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against  this penalty . "" this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting "" ,  a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb ' s stand and  refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the  political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration  between the centre and dpc is currently on .  the financial express , friday , april 27 , 2001  foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog & raghu mohan  global banks comfortable with enron pull - out  lenders to the dabhol power company ( dpc ) are a sharply divided lot .  international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones  led by the the industrial develoment bank of india ( idbi ) , are categorical  that additional assistance to dpc  , s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite  the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a  preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state  electricity board ( mseb ) within the next four weeks . this follows the  authorisation given to enron india  , s managing director k wade cline and dpc  president & ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer  notices to mseb , following wednesday  , s dpc board meeting in london .  the essence of the message from the international lenders following the  london meeting with dpc board is : emotions do not work . contractual  obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has  failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with  the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc  , s  debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders  are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is .  however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a  messy affair .  sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to  phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect  their interests more given that they have no security  * other than assets  *  like a sovereign cover .  & it was this desperation that made local lenders like  idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5  per cent ,  8 a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made  clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were : a )  there are contractual obligations b ) mseb was not punctual in its payments to  dpc and c ) mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore  rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of  power .  while local lenders led by idbi  * with mseb parroting the same  * were of the  view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders  were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is  despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination  given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers  pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and  protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped  in its present form . the points of contention are : a ) that phase - i of dpc is  backed by a sovereign guarantee b ) phase - ii is not and c ) to the extent that  phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets  *  even those under phase - i  * getting attached . therefore , an examination on the  segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted .  pti adds : in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to  sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial  liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc  president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of  power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday .  the indian express , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron : dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb  the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp ,  has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) that it  intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held  in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo  neil mcgregor and enron india  , s managing director k wade cline to serve a   +  + preliminary  ,  , termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the  next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb  began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power $ 48 million for  power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after  mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply  power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid $ 24  million for february . and a payment of $ 31 million was made for march on  thursday .  the $ 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india  to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to  suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary  termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to  the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision  as a  +  + procedural  ,  , move consistent with dpc  , s negotiating strategy to  recover overdue payments from the mseb .  after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would  be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the  company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated ,  the government of india will have to take a hit of $ 300 million besides  paying bills of rs 1 , 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty .   +  + our ( centre  , s ) liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be  one year  , s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million ,  ,  , power  secretary a k basu said .  +  + contractually , the centre will have to pay one year  ,  s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , 400 - 1 , 500 crore ,  and take over dpc  , s debt , which stands at around $ 300 million , if the project  was terminated ,  ,  , basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of  completing the second phase of the 2 , 184 - megawatt power - plant project , which  is 95 per cent through .  while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company  to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the  company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the  meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had  strongly opposed dpc  , s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices  for termination .  mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar  * both  directors on the dpc board  * and the state principal secretary ( energy ) vm  lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in  london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly  +  + threatening  ,  , to issue various  arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in  isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the  mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra  * a step  typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war ,  coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc  , s move was  viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire  because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the  company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around  rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers .  the hindu , friday , april 27 , 2001  offer of renegotiation ' too late ' : enron , by mahesh vijapurkar  mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night  authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power  purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board , has  decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that  the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in  reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa .  as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , ` ` it is not sudden death  of the project ' ' and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the  developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole  committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . ` ` this would  only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot  of legal work is involved ' ' . apparently , the dpc intends to do some  arm - twisting .  at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially  disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions  on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the  offer of renegotiation had come rather ` ` too late ' ' . it also said it did not  see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out  the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to  authorise termination was a new weapon .  the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc  would not take any ` ` harsh step ' ' which would cause lot of damage to the  interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today  he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the  strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation  was the requirement and not confrontation .  echo in ls  the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister ,  mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre  rs . 2 , 840 crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the  centre ' s liability in case of termination is one year ' s electricity bill and  a termination fee of $ 300 million .  blow to fis  the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial  institutions ( fis ) which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to  convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of  indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee  either of the centre or the state .  the times of india , friday , 27 april 2001  enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait  the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised  the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state  electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet ,  considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured  renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though  foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial  institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over  the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders '  consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project .  the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice  was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a  move .  another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the  financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the  project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms .  institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package ,  which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . ` ` the board  has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the  meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the  project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , ' ' said mseb  chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . ` ` mseb presented their  views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included  the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings .  ` ` we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high  and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable , "" bansal added .  ` ` they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our  exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any  plans in that direction , ' ' said a top banker who was present during the  lenders ' meet . ` ` there is a general consensus that the project must be  completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , ' '  he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank ,  credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india ,  where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company  officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination  notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project  favours such proceedings .  meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa .  ` ` we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that  would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , ' ' deshmukh said . deshmukh was  echoing union power minister suresh prabhu ' s sentiments , who said that the  government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however ,  added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and  dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $ 2 . 9 billion project would  be a blow to india ' s efforts to woo foreign investors .  the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three  arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues  amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december  2000 and january 2001 . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the  march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest  payment , despite the dispute over the amount .  when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc .  the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , 2001  dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice  the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) has authorised the  managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to  terminate its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state  electricity board ( mseb ) ` ` at an appropriate time ' ' . the decision was taken  at a board meeting held in london yesterday . ` ` while mseb , which is an  ` interested party ' , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation  clarifying its stand on the matter , ' ' a senior state government official  said .  the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice  was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the  official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to  a six - month ` ` suspension period ' ' . according to clause 17 . 8 of the  termination procedure , of the ppa : ` ` following the giving of a preliminary  termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months ( or  such longer period as they may agree ) as to what step shall be taken with a  view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to  all the circumstances . . . ' '  idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier  persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination  notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company  to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in  favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however ,  domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa  is abandoned mid - way .  according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the  parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and  central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao  deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the  state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance  minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . ` ` the dpc will now  have to decide what is the ` appropriate time ' to serve the notice , ' ' the  official said . mseb pays rs 134 crore : meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs 134  crore towards its march 2001 bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was  paid ` in protest ' ' today morning . ` ` they ( dpc ) had billed us for an amount of  rs 146 crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , ' ' a senior  mseb official said .  the pioneer , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron testing maharashtra ' s nerves , t n raghunatha  dabhol power company ( dpc ) has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra  state electricity board ( mseb ) , the maharashtra state government and the  centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the  dpc board of directors ' decision to authorise its managing director to serve  a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication .  the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company  management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could  inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , 840 crore on the centre . the decision  to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was  taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government  representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of "" interested  party "" .  when contacted , the company ' s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal ,  declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board .  "" we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london . we will express  our views after a few days , "" he said . however , maharashtra chief minister  vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board ' s decision as  "" unfortunate "" . "" we have already requested the company not to take any harsh  decision "" , mr deshmukh said in mumbai .  official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board ' s  decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the  mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its  tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can  formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state  government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state  electricity board . the sources said that the dpc ' s reported decision to  authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did  not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping  of the power contract with the mseb .  "" if anything , the dpc ' s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on  the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger  position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm  itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its  control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb ,  the centre and the state government , "" the sources said . not surprisingly , the  dpc ' s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government ' s  decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the  mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron ' s  subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state  electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination  notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of  the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dpc .  riday , april 27  the telegraph , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron signal to switch off dabhol power  enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol  power company when it won an authorisation from the company  , s board to stop  sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) .  the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65  per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m  lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders  discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre  , s liability ,  if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year  , s power bill and a  termination fee of $ 300 million . however , the company will have to wait for  six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the  centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on  foreign investment in power if enron walks out .  & we do not see fdi inflows  into the power sector being hit ,  8 power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb  officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate  policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the  decision coincided with a rs 134 - crore  + protest payment  , by the cash - strapped  power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 . 64 crore .  there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers  at enron  , s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of  events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb  officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on  wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide  bandh .  & we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up  at the dispute - resolution forum ,  8 a board official said . last week , dpc told  the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a  move to fortify its legal position .  mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold  around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in  terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game  because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions  are not covered under the centre  , s and state  , s counter - guarantees , unlike  those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh called enron  , s decision unfortunate .  & we had told state government  officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding  up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties .  8  the statesman , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron threatens to pull out  the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power  company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to  serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $ 2 . 9  billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of  dabhol  , s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday  in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state  electricity board , mr vinay bansal .  while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was  itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before  the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress  party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu ,  who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao  deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday .  the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre  is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its  counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political  force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of  exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr  suresh prabhu , contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 . 7 per  cent of the total energy output of the country , its termination would not  have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation .  however , if terminations proceedings go through , enron corp , a 65 per cent  share - holder in the dabhol power company , would stand to net a hefty amount  in damages . the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that  termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 , 800 crore , which is the  total of one years  , electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million .  according to an energy analyst , mr pradyumna kaul , the total liability would  not cross rs 350 crore . however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that  the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 , 840 crore . it  is learnt that on 20 april , mr deshmukh had given the go - ahead to the mseb to  prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc  , s  board of directors on wednesday . at the meeting , the energy minister ,  padamsinh patil , energy secretary , mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr  vinay bansal , were also present . the notice was prepared over the past weekend  and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april .  however , the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough , given  its huge stake in the project , and that such a notice would not be necessary .  the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff ,  with enron  , s consent .  among those present at the london meeting were mr lal , mr bansal and mseb  technical director , mr p paunikar , in their capacity as directors . however ,  they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party . the  only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also  represented on the board , it is learnt . the chief minister , mr vilasrao  deshmukh , said the state was not in favour of terminating the project . this  could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm - twist the indian authorities  could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over  the past three months cleared . the mseb owes enron rs 146 . 64 crore for march  2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001 . the centre today put  up a brave face on enron  , s decision saying there would not be any adverse  effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country , pti reported  from new delhi .   & there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or  foreign company . as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact  on fdi in power sector ,  8 power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when  asked about dpc  , s decision to authorise management to issue a termination  notice to mseb . emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision ,  prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs   & we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as  european nations in the power sector .  & in fact not only the power minister but  also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power  and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector .  8  mid day  ' dpc may not wind up '  maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor ,  managing director of the dabhol power corporation ( dpc ) , has been given  complete powers with regard to dpc ' s operations in the state , including the  authority to wind up operations , it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor  will issue such a termination notice . mcgregor was given the powers at a  meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday . ranganathan said that state  officials , including maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) chairman  vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal , have reported back to him about the  meeting in london .  with regard to the state ' s failure to pay enron , ranganathan said , "" bills  are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) and dpc owes some  money to us . our people informed enron officials about this . . in fact , there  was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice . "" in the  london meeting , mseb and industrial development bank of india ( idbi )  representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could  not supply power whenever needed .  chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the  decision of the board of the enron - promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to  wind up operations . deshmukh added , "" we have already requested enron not to  take any harsh decision . "" deshmukh had earlier said , "" we have directed state  government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy  company from winding up operations in the state , as it would be harmful to  both of us . ""  enron officials are keeping mum on the issue . mcgregor said , "" i am not going  to give any comment . ""  mid day , april 27 , 2001  enron offers ' no comment ' on renegotiation , h s rao  a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company  ( dpc ) , promoted by the us energy major enron , was held here yesterday  apparently to discuss fate of its $ 900 - million power project in maharashtra ,  but there was no official word on the indian and state governments ' decision  to renegotiate the contract .  an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting , saying  the issues discussed at the meeting were ' confidential ' . "" we have not  received any direct communication . unless we get it and evaluate the details ,  we have no comments to make , "" the spokesman said when asked about the  proposed decision on re - negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra  state electricity board ( mseb ) has 15 per cent stake .  asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing  director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india , the spokesman said  he had nothing to say on them . enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to  look at various options including selling the company ' s stake in dpc .  maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state  government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company . he said the  maharashtra government "" is not in favour of terminating the 2184 - mw project ,  but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio . ""  mid day , friday , april 27 , 2001 ,  committee to renegotiate enron deal  a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power  company will be appointed by this evening , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh  said today . addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social  reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha , deshmukh said the  committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow , at the most . he  termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil  mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state  electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with  power company .  "" renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole  committee and the center will also depute its representative on the  renegotiating committee . we don ' t want to take any hasty decision , "" deshmukh  saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its  expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably . when  pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite  state  9 s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee , chief minister  said it was unfortunate .  earlier , in his meeting with hazare , deshmukh promised to make necessary  amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so  that the information was easily accessed by the common people . he also gave a  patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state  departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry  within three months .  afternoon , april 27 , 2001  ' enron ' s on ! '  state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz  the us power giant , enron power corporation ' s willingness to wrap up the  dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise ,  though the dabhol power company chief , mr . wade cline , has been authorised to  do so , since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the  matter .  disclosing this , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that  the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power  project at dabhol could be continued , and at the same time enron did not feel  slighted . "" enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision . we are  waiting for their letter , "" he said . when asked what sort of compromise the  state government plans to forge , mr . deshmukh said , "" let our officers come  back . after that we will decide a future course of action . but we are  definitely going in for renegotiation of the project . it is very difficult to  predict the outcome of enron ' s decision but as of now the project is still  on . "" when asked whether the project could be moved to another state , if wound  up from maharashtra , mr . deshmukh said , that was not possible as per the  terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government .  however , it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself , he  indicated . he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses  if the project was terminated .  the board of directors of the dabhol power company , which met in london on  wednesday , decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project  once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project , if he  deemed it fit . however , this decision , as of now , does not necessarily  indicate the death knell for the project . the enron project , which had been  riddled with controversies right from its inception , had been a pretext for  the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to  time . the previous sena - bjp government , which had been out to terminate the  project , however , chose to continue with it following renegotiations with  enron ' s top visiting officials like ms . rebecca mark . and , the democratic  front government inherited the controversial project when the governments  changed hands a year and a half ago .  meanwhile , state energy minister dr . padamsinh patil , when contacted at the  osmanabad circuit house , said the state government and the central government  have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with  enron . "" it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that .  they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both  sides , "" he said . in case the project is terminated , the government can still  manage the power needs of the state , though it would be a bit tough job , he  added .",0

"" it ' s a market with mix of small and large players and companies that define  their roles differently , "" said ken weilerstein , an analyst at gartner group  inc . in stamford , conn . enron ' s plan also could help enterprise - level users  get additional benefits along with the storage capacity they ' re renting , such  as security and disaster recovery support , he added .  ravi thuraisingham , director of global bandwidth risk management at enron  broadband services , said the new offering won ' t include additional security  features . but enron does plan to standardize on a set of ssp services and  bundle them with disaster recovery and communications bandwidth capabilities ,  he said .  initially , enron - - which had total revenue of $ 101 billion last year - -  expects to charge users monthly fees of $ 25 to $ 55 per gigabyte of managed  storage , depending on market conditions and the length of time a company  expects to need the capacity . "" we ' re there to try to discover a market  clearing price , "" said thuraisingham , adding that the service is tentatively  due to go online in the third quarter .  enron said it has already signed best buy co . , one of the leading retailers  of consumer electronics , computers and software in the u . s . , to buy the  storage capacity it needs to support a customer relationship management  application through storagenetworks . connecting users such as best buy to  available storage could take anywhere from three days to three months ,  according to thuraisingham .  under enron ' s plan , storage capacity owned by participating ssps will be  connected to an existing network of switching hubs through which the company  currently trades telecommunications bandwidth . enron said it has 18 switching  centers , or "" pooling points , "" in the u . s . , and another seven overseas .  at first , the company plans to focus its attention on ssps in boston and  other metropitan areas where the necessary networking plumbing can be easily  installed . but even there , thuraisingham said , enron is "" pretty much in the  initial stages of getting ssps up to speed on what the market is about . ""  enron has been managing online trades of telecommunications bandwidth since  the spring of 1999 . later that year , it also launched a web site called  enrononline that oversees the trading of natural gas , electricity and other  commodities . that quickly became the world ' s largest e - commerce site and is  now said to be processing more than $ 1 billion worth of transactions daily .  norman levine  enron broadband services  713 - 853 - 5010  norman _ levine @ enron . net",0

mail . my phone number is ( 617 ) 492 - 9551 .  i graduated from princeton university in 1996 ( mathematics ) , and came  straight to mit for a  ph . d . in operations management at the sloan schoolof management . in my first  three years i took all the required coursework in mathematics ,  optimization , stochastic processes , etc . , as well as a number of courses in  psychology ( at mit and harvard ) . i am working with prof . gabriel bitran ,  and i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations . in  particular , i am interested in the interaction between customers and  companies ( hence the interest in psychology ) . the ( tentative ) title of my  phd thesis is "" pricing substitute products on the internet "" , and i am  sending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few weeks ago that will  give you an idea of what this research is about .  thanks again , and i ' m looking forward to meeting you and your research  group next week .  paulo  pricing substitute products on the internet  objective :  to develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold  on  the internet .  motivation :  this research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and  optimization  models are not appropriate for internet - related businesses . the technological  innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of  information  which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices .  furthermore ,  companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can  have access to .  the problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue  faced  by internet companies . consumers usually search for generic products ( e . g .  vcrs  or computers ) without knowing exactly what they will buy . companies can show  different products and different prices to each consumer . this type of  flexibility  was not available until the internet came about .  the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the  methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of  other settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are  many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a  given company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer  to which customers and how much to charge for these services .  research strategy :  our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components  which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these  components are choice models and optimization models .  choice models :  choice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature  draws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the  common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic  elimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options  based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice  remains .  these methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very  easily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models  that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological  models .  the most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with  these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how  consumer make choices on the internet . the first step in our research will  be  to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between  customers  and companies on the internet .  optimization :  traditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a  certain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue  still exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term  profit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well you know  your customers and are able to retain them . the optimization problem must  therefore include a short term component ( sales ) and a long term component  ( learning ) .",0

"Subject: enron ' s new weather system , courtesy the research dept .  v  last night , i tested our new system for real - time surveillance and messaging  of the weather , and it delivers the data to desktops throughout the building  more than 6 1 / 2 minutes before the national weather service updates their  webpages . our current technology was web - scraping these pages via ftp , then  parsing into a database . the impact of these 6 1 / 2 minutes for the hourly  power traders is enormous - the weather stations upload their data around 53  minutes after the hour , and we can now receive them within 2 minutes later .  we can now re - estimate our nonlinear stack model before the top of the hour ,  when hourly power trading begins . otherwise , we would not have model results  until around 15 minutes after the hour . notably , hourly power trading is , for  all intents and purposes , concluded by then ( they trade for 10 - 15 minutes and  manage the scheduling for the next 30 or so miutes ) . so , effectively , we may  now be one * hour * ahead of where we were just a few days ago , in terms of  information . people are very excited up here , from the cto on down - thanks  for letting it happen .  c",0

( by taking demand from our  competitors ) . i believe , at the moment , there are no bandwidth exchanges that  allow "" combinatorial "" bids . if we are the first one to do it , we might  improve our sale channel and gain some market share . ( note : auction - > one  seller and many buyers : exchange - > many sellers and many buyers . )  moreover , i think auctioning the unsold bandwidth will not hurt us because we  cannot sell them anyway . in addition , we ourselves can be a dummy bidder in  the system and bid in the auction . if the current wining bid is too low , we  can just over - bid it and keep the product . this way , we can indirectly put a  reserve price on the products .  let ' s meet sometime in the first week of january .  - chonawee",0

"Subject: capital book  to further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing enron america ' s velocity of capital and associated return on invested capital , we have decided to create a capital book . the capital book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by joe deffner . the purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within enron americas , with any form of capital requirement , are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge .  the previous numbers used in the business plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets . therefore , on any assets currently held within each business area , the capital charge will remain at 15 % . internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating business unit subject to the internal ownership policy outlined below .  the cost of capital associated with all transactions in enron americas will be set by joe . this process is separate and apart from the current rac process for transactions which will continue unchanged .  capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15 % . transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15 % across the board charge . transactions which are structured off balance sheet , but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on enron america ' s overall credit capacity .  on transactions that deploy capital through the trading books , the capital book will take a finance reserve on each transaction , similar to the way the credit group takes a credit reserve . this finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction . as noted above , the capital book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost .  by sending market - based capital pricing signals internally , enron america ' s sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization .  questions regarding the capital book can be addressed to :  joe deffner 853 - 7117  alan quaintance 345 - 7731",0

"Subject: color copier  thanks for your immediate response .  the problem seems to be the cost .  iain , i have the smallest group but we are  willing to pay what it takes for the copier .  on the other hand there may be other groups  that are larger and may not need the copier  as much and are not willing to pay the cost .  seems to me , the copier is a necessity for the floor ,  it would save not only time , but money also  in the long haul .  we have updated every possibility on the  32 nd floor and this copier is needed for quick  presentations , meetings , etc . and allows everyone  not to depend on color printers as much !  ( gives us choices )  please after today , once we get together regarding  this matter , i will let ina continue with the process ,  whereby , i can continue focusing on what is best  for my group as well as the floor .  thanks  kevin moore",0

"Subject: energy book  hi grant ,  hope all is well with you . i trust you got my message via the voicemail  that ileft with vince late friday afternoon about my inability to travel -  i ' m trying to rearrange my trip for a couple of week ' s time when my ear has  cleared up , and i look forward to meeting with you one day .  i wrote to vince last week asking for a favour , but i ' m not sure ifhe is  there in houston . i know that you guys are probably very busy but i was  wondering if you can write a few sentences for me . i ' m sending out some  sample chapters to the people who responded positively ( all of them ! ) to my  request for some feedback on the book . chapter 1 has an ' overview ' of the  book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter . could you please  write a sentence or two for your chapter ?  i ' m including what i have already written ( although i think it has changed  slightly from this version ) so that you can see the style .  many thanks and best regards .  chris .  2 overview of this book  this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk  management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give  an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy  assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing  the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we  discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo  simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the  book .  in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing  empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model  the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean  reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and  showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated .  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski and grant masson of enron capital and  trade .  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such  curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets  the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined  curves . what we do in this chapter  chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative  structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of  products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors  and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or  average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options .  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter  including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate  model with jumps .  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style  options .  chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a  multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility  structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are  developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo  schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the  valuation of american style options .  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions .  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced  with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta  hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma  hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of  chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also  discussed .  chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta ,  delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we  look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market  variables .",0

"Subject: var  david ,  during today ' s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues  related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations .  mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system :  we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds  of available cpu memory . also , in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor  and it ' s difficult to model the price curves independently : we solve the problem by mapping  them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves .  we have agreed on the following :  1 . winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can increase the number  of forward price curves that are simulated as basic ( core ) curves . he will investigate the impact of a larger  number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run .  2 . the curves associated with the biggest 10 - 20 positions in each commodity should be  modeled as core curves ( i . e . no mapping into other locations ) . it makes sense to monitor  the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates .  3 . the results of an automated clustering ( mapping ) procedures should be systematically  monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions .  this responsibility should be vested with one person ( right now the responsibility is  dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody  is responsible ) . research can allocate one person to this task ;  cooperation of trading and rac will be critical .  vince",0

"Subject: california update 3 / 15 / 01  executive summary  ? davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for  past utility debt  ? davis and pg & e negotiations at a standstill , sticking point is net short  for pg & e this summer  ? as the days go on with no word of a secured deal , involuntary bankruptcy  chances increase significantly among small generators and qfs  ? ferc would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions  for california  california public utility commission rate increases  today may be the turning point as the ca puc reviews the size of the  department of water resources ( dwr ) rate increase to be passed along to  consumers on their electricity bills . until now , davis has considered rate  hikes to be political suicide , but there may be some relief for him from  consumer groups . sources indicate that one of california ' s main consumer  advocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption ,  but remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt . dwr ,  which is currently buying power on behalf of the state , needs more income to  securitize the planned $ 10 b bond issue that is key part of davis ' plan to  sign long term power contracts . as dwr continues to spend $ 40 to $ 60 m every  day on power purchases , a well placed source informed us the dwr is  essentially bankrupt . it currently has no money for normal activities such  as ordering supplies , purchasing new equipment , etc . the department of  finance is forwarding dwr money from where ever it can ( parks , other  programs ) to purchase power , but dwr ' s hands are tied until revenue bonds are  issued . the california state treasurer phil angelides will be submitting a  recommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover $ 10  billion worth of state bonds .  davis & pg & e at odds  sources report that davis and pg & e negotiations are facing two difficult  challenges : 1 ) pg & e wants 2 . 9 times book , which is far more than consumer  groups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines ( sce accepted 2 . 3 ) ,  and 2 ) pg & e needs relief from davis for pg & es legal responsibility to be the  ultimate power purchaser for the state , and at this point davis wants to  limit further state energy power purchases ( especially for summer ) . the  utilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars  further in the red ( $ 3 to $ 4 b ) and pg a measure that if accomplished would  provide davis with even less negotiating power .  with all this activity , davis is starting to lose support in the state  legislature . sources report increasing tension between the governor and  state senate president pro - tem john burton . burton has just announced a  special senate committee will investigate the generators for evidence of  price manipulation , and the state auditor is also planning an investigation .  davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being  picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later .  qf ' s most likely source of involuntary bankruptcy  sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience  and force bankruptcy on the utilities . sb 47 x may have been california ' s  qualified facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing  against pg & e , socal ed , and sdg & e . the bill designed to cut the qf ' s costs  and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the state ' s  senate . sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further  investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates .  out with hebert , in with wood  the bush administration favors replacing hebert , jr . with texas puc head pat  wood . there is an intense battle behind the scenes between senate republican  leader trent lott , who favors hebert , and president bush , who wants wood .  the administration would prefer wood because they do not want ferc to pick a  fight with davis which means bush might ultimately lose some western states  in 2004 . in effort to tone down the recent press reports , hebert has made  several token concessions to california , including $ 69 million worth of power  refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and  power plant installation .  it ' s is expected that ferc would most likely approve any transmission deal  that davis could complete but with a list of conditions . some conditions  might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well  as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic administrative actions in  the west next year . the bush administration is opposed to price caps and  believes in free market solutions . the administration is also considering  whether it might be a good idea to privatize federally - owned assets such as  bpa .",0
"Subject: option pricing discrepancy for j . c . penny transaction  amitava and seksan have identified the source of the discrepancy between the  option prices calculated by the credit - reserve model and the stand - alone  spreadsheet model used in deal pricing . the discrepancy can be traced to  differences in input variables of the two models and not to any algorithmic  differences .  the options being priced are a strip of options on monthly instruments . the  credit reserve simulation program calculates the time to expiration by  assuming that the option expires on first day of the contract month of the  underlying contract , which is a very reasonable assumption .  the stand - alone option pricing spreadsheet allows specification of the option  expiration date independent of the contract month of the underlying . in the  jc penney transaction , the monthly options were assumed to expire in the  middle of the contract month , when in reality the underlying monthly  contracts expire before the start of their respective contract months . the  stand - alone spreadsheet model allows such specifications and it is up to the  user to ascertain that the expiration dates entered are legal . at present ,  seksan is ascertaining that the option contracts involved are in deed monthly  options and not a strip of daily options , in which case we would require  estimates of intramonth volatilities for both the spreadsheet model and the  credit reserve model .  regards ,  rabi de",0

"Subject: precious metals var  jason ,  after our brief discussion last night i think i should discuss a few of the  issues i have with respect to calculating a var on the deal that you are  proposing . the var model , as i illustrated , is set up to accept a term  structure of delta positions , prices and vols and it may be difficult to  translate the ' silver mine ' position into these inputs .  i do not think that we can simply take the net silver content of the mine and  then make some assumptions about vol and price . the var model  also assumes a certain amount of liquidity in the market and a 1 day holding  period .  to do this properly i would need to understand fully how the deal is priced  as these sensitivities are ultimately what will effect the change in mtm  in the future and that is essentially what var is supposed to predict .  if you need me to work on this then you need to contact steve who will help  to prioritise my time . i will also need to consult with vince kaminski and  tanya tamarachenko in houston for advice .  rac will also assist in the process .  please contact me if you have any further questions ,  kirstee  x 34529",0

"" vincejkaminski ""  cc :  subject : ? preface for book  vince ,  hope you are well .  we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book , and ?  you  kindly offered that you would provide this . is this still ? possible ? we  realise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ? ahead and wrote  something , which is below , and if you want to review , change or ? re - write the  preface , that would be very appreciated . let me know ? what your thoughts  are .  thanks ,  julie  ( we ' re getting close )  preface  one of our main objectives in ? writing energy derivatives : pricing and risk  management has been to bring ? together as many of the various approaches  for the  pricing and risk management ? energy derivatives as possible , to discuss  in - depth  the models , and to show how ? they relate to each other . in this ? way we hope  to  help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide ? range of  energy  derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses a ? consistent  modelling framework . we ? believe that for practitioners this last point is  very  important and we continue ? to stress in our articles and presentations the  dangers of having flawed risk ? management and giving arbitrage opportunities  to  your competitors by using ? ad - hoc and inconsistent models for different  instruments and markets ( see also others who propose consistent ? models ? ) .  however , it is not ? our wish to concentrate on one particular model or  models ,  at the exclusion of ? the others because we believe that the choice should  rest  with the user ? ( although it will probably be clear from our discussions the  model ( s ) we ? prefer ) . we therefore try and give ? as clear account as possible  of the advantage and disadvantages of all the ? models so that the reader can  make an informed choice as to the models which ? best suit their needs .  in order to meet our objectives the ? book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to ?  model and  price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the ? book . in  addition to introducing ? the techniques that underlie the black - scholes  modelling framework we outline ? the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and  monte carlo simulation for ? derivative pricing , which are used throughout the  book .  in chapter 2 we discuss the ? analysis of spot energy prices . as ? well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes ? that  can  be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of geometric  brownian motion as well as ? mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump  processes , discussing each and ? showing how they can be simulated and their  parameters estimated .  chapter 3 , written by vince ? kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron  corp . , discusses volatility ? estimation in energy commodity markets . ? this  chapter builds on the previous one . it examines in detail the methods , ?  merits  and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different ? pricing  models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and electricity  markets are used to illustrate ? the technical and interpretative aspects of  calculating volatility .  chapter 4 examines forward curves ? in the energy markets . although ? such  curves  are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial ? markets , the  difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well ? defined  curves .  in this chapter we ? describe forward price bounds for energy prices and the  building of forward ? curves from market instruments . we ? outline the three  main  approaches which have been applied to building forward ? curves in energy  markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric approach , and ? deriving  analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic factors .  chapter 5 presents an overview of ? structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses . examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as  energy  swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback  options ,  and ladder options .  chapter 6 investigates single and ? multi - factor models of the energy spot  price  and the pricing of some standard ? energy derivatives . closed form ? solutions  for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices ? both on  the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the models in ? this  chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience yield and interest  rate model .  chapter 7 shows how the prices of ? path dependent and american style options  can  be evaluated for the models in ? chapter 6 . simulation schemes are ? developed  for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety ? of  path  dependent options . in order ? to price options which incorporate early  exercise  opportunities , a trinomial ? tree scheme is developed . this tree ? is built to  be  consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to ? price exotic  as  well as standard european and american style options .  chapter 8 describes a methodology ? for valuing energy options based on  modelling  the whole of the market observed ? forward curve . the approach results ? in a  multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined volatility structures  can be of an extremely general ? form . closed - form solutions are ? developed  for  pricing standard european options , and efficient monte carlo ? schemes are  presented for pricing exotic options . the chapter closes with a discussion of  the valuation of american style options .  chapter 9 focuses on the risk ? management of energy derivative positions . ?  in  this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions ? that  trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem ?  of  managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a portfolio  containing derivatives and look ? at extensions to gamma hedging ?  illustrating  the techniques using both spot and ? forward curve models . the general ? model  presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor hedging of a ?  portfolio  of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .  chapter 10 examines the key risk ? management concept of value at risk ( var )  applied to portfolios containing ? energy derivative products . after ?  discussing  the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs ? ( volatilities ,  covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then compare the fours  major ? methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma , historical  simulation and ? monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same portfolio  of  energy ? options . in this chapter we also ? look at testing the var estimates  for  various underlying energy market ? variables .  finally , in chapter 11 we review ? modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we  look  in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan  ( 1997 ) )  and ? creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial ? products ( 1997 ) ) for which  detailed  information is publicly available . together these provide an extensive set ?  of  tools with which to measure credit risk . we present numerical examples of  applying these techniques to energy derivatives .  before ? we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book  are tools ? which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of how  both  the ? tool ? ? and the market works . the ? techniques we describe are certainly  not  ? magic wands ? which can be waved at ? data and risk management problems to  provide instant and perfect solutions . to quote from the riskmetrics  technical  document ? ? no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace experience and  professional judgement in managing risk . ? . ? however , the right tools ,  correctly  used make the job a lot ? easier !",0

"Subject: re : outage tracker option and background  karl ,  thanks a lot . i have passed this information to grant masson  who worked here on a related problem .  he will get in touch with you regarding this technology .  vince  karl tomlinson @ enron _ development  07 / 24 / 2000 06 : 00 pm  to : vince j kaminski @ ect  cc :  subject : outage tracker option and background  vince ,  to follow up on the idea of a means for effectively tracking instantanious  plant faliure utilising either system frequency or connection point voltage .  the system frequency phase shift across a network will probably be the best  option as this would allow alll significant deviations to be tracked along  with relative network performance from a few points .  i am currently chasing nemmco ( au system operator ) to get hold of a few weeks  of 4 second metering data for the whole system to see if there is enough  measurement consistency to prove one of the ideas .  the idea follows along the lines ( literally ! ) that when a unit fails it will  introduce a shock into the system and reduce system frequency , which is then  reacted to by frequency control services offered in by generators . the drop  in frequency is noticable across the whole network and as one option may  change the phase shift across the whole grid . the phase shift across the  network is constantly changing due to loads and power factor correctrion  devices switching on and off , however a unit failure may be distinct .  the second option relates to how a unit fails , whereby if a circuit breaker  is involved as in the case of uncontrolled shutdowns , then the outage will  cause an rf pulse that should propogate across some of the network .  transformers will attenuate the pulse , however it should be detectable many  miles away from the fault location . measure the arrival time at several point  on the network , work out the shift and backtrack on the network . part of the  solution is already proven in lightning trackers . the solution may be made  more simple by detecting the exact point on the sinewave that the unit failed  ( i . e . measuring the three phases at lmhz and then sending the data through a  dsp ) . this solution is more complex , however this should allow unit failure  to be pinpointed to a station . the timing base for each of the nodes may be  sourced from gps timing , self locating at the same time !  will send you some links and documents for potentail hardware and setups .  karl .",0

"" we are excited to be positioning the maac organization to address the needs  of  the new competitive era , thanks to the interest and participation of the  stakeholders for over two years . "" stated pete landrieu , maac executive board  chair .  phillip g . harris , regional manager of maac , commented "" the relationship  between  reliability and markets will be enhanced and strengthened by the maac  restructuring . we are also pleased to be making this change as effectively as  possible through the use of existing pjm organizational and other resources . ""  under the filed agreement , a new maac members committee is chartered with the  creation of the approval process of the maac reliability principles and  standards . other new maac committees are chartered , most notably , a maac  energy  market committee to serve as a forum for the discussion of the impact of  reliability on the commercial market place , and the marketplace on  reliability .  the agreement also provides for stakeholder representation on the maac board .  appropriate amendments to existing pjm agreements will be discussed with the  pjm  members and filed with the ferc .  the mid - atlantic area council was established in december 1967 to augment the  reliability of the bulk electric supply systems of its members through  coordinated planning of generation and transmission facilities . the maac  region  encompasses nearly 50 , 000 square miles from virginia to new york and from the  atlantic ocean to the great lakes . under the existing maac agreement and the  operating agreement of pjm interconnection , l . l . c . , maac and pjm members are  obligated to comply with maac and nerc operating and planning principles and  standards .  please do not reply to this message . if you have a question for pjm customer  relations and training , please send an e - mail to custsvc @ pjm . com .  to unsubscribe from this list , send an e - mail to majordomo @ majordomo . pjm . com  containing only the following line in the body of the e - mail :  unsubscribe pjm - customer - info",0
"Subject: re : progress  steve ,  thanks a lot . i think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards  understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no  bugs in translation of a business problem ( for example , complicated  credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality ) into the  code .  regarding tanya ' s attitude . just a few points .  1 . i don ' t think she has the skills to do the system administrator ' s work  and she does not have the  necessary privileges . this explains why she keeps asking winston for help .  it ' s  not that the work is beneath her .  2 . some members of tanya ' s team came to me complaining about winston .  he effectively told them to go away and work on the "" research projects ""  and that he would take care of the it issues . i don ' t think that it ' s just  tanya ' s issue ,  though i agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful .  3 . the reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat on  tanya and  me whenever there is any performance problems and / or they intuitively  disagree with the results of a run . they could not care less about the  demarcation line between it and research . they also want tanya  to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code .  the bottom line is that we are in full agreement : tanya and  winston have to work as a team and i shall work on my end to make sure that  it happens .  credit is emerging as a critical issue for enron for the next few weeks and  the system cannot fail .  vince  from : stephen stock / enron @ enronxgate on 01 / 11 / 2001 08 : 23 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : progress  vince ,  i got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking  about some specific solutions to performance of it systems . . . in particular  distributed processing . also i heard that you had concerns about the use of  multiple languages etc . . . .  both of these sound like what i was discussing with you on previous  occasions . . . do you feel the need to discuss these further ?  the multi - language issue isn ' t really that much of an issue , as the current  system is 98 % java right now . although i am a big fan of c / c + + ( it is my main  development skill ) , i am also very aware that java is a much more evolved  and robust language . i had serious doubts about the performance , but i ' ve had  a review conducted , and the results are showing the sun unix implementation  to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than c / c + + because of something  they call hot - spot technology . ( its an instruction caching technique , i  believe ) . the concerns i expressed to you , were really about how technical  people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively  meaningless metric like portability .  on the issue of distributed processing . . . the original review i had conducted  by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution , and as zhiyong wei  is already working on global valuation project , winston is actively working  with zhiyong to see if he can model the var architecture on that , and also to  find a common valuation piece between the systems .  i ' d like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some  time over the next few days ?  also , i sat in on the tanya / winston meeting yesterday and as per our  discussion at the elevator , i attempted to help her argument by suggesting to  all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code . . . i . e .  seperating research domain problems from it problems .  she said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could  get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were . i asked her how she would  measure that , and she said she would instrument the code manually by  inserting timing elements at strategic points . i mentioned that a profiling  tool could probably do this job for her . tanya again said that stepping  through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code , and that  studying documentation wasn ' t enough .  about 6 weeks ago , i commissioned a team to document the system down to  psuedo - code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon .  ( in fact i ' ve asked for a draft copy to be given to tanya right now ) , and  winston is also working on a draft research / it "" working together "" document ,  which will identify how the exchange of information takes place .  tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated it developer to do  all the environment setup for her , because she doesn ' t really want to have to  do that . i think that this is probably the root cause of the issue . the it  guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good , as  it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her . she is  claiming that they are un - cooperative . . . . they are claiming that she  continually asks the same questions about set - up over and over again , and  doesn ' t seem to want to learn how to do it . winston on the other hand , could  be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and  an it issue and ask for help from research .  i think you debbie and i need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely .  i have asked tanya and winston to go ahead and work very closely together  over the next few days . . . . and debbie brackett and i will review their  progress on friday .  in the meantime l ' ll be looking at setting up a working test environment that  doesn ' t involve my main quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer  term solution .  regards  steve",0

"Subject: organizational announcement - introducing enron engineering and  operational services  in order to better align our engineering and operations capabilities with the  commercial businesses they support , we are pleased to announce the following  organizational change will be effective immediately . a new business unit ,  enron engineering and operational services ( eeos ) , is being formed which will  include our existing operations in enron engineering and construction company  ( ee & cc ) , operational energy corporation ( oec ) , and national energy production  corporation ( nepco ) .  brian stanley , as president and chief executive officer , and keith dodson , as  chief operating officer will provide the leadership for this new  organization , reporting to the office of the chairman of enron wholesale  services . nepco will continue to operate as a stand - alone business under  john gillis , president .  with the majority of ee & cc and oec  , s activities focused on assets and  projects which are in wholesale services , this will better align the efforts  of eeos with the commercial businesses it supports . while eeos will be a  stand - alone unit within enron wholesale services it will work very closely  with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports .  this realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabilities  in a single business segment and should ensure that innovation and best  practices are shared and implemented across our many operations and will also  allow for better identification of priorities and more effective allocation  of resources to these projects . consistent with this approach , development  engineering will have dual reporting to both eeos and the business units  which they support .  with an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wide  variety of new development opportunities available to enron , it is critical  that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design ,  construct , commission , and effectively manage and operate enron  , s assets on a  global basis .  this new global business unit should insure that we will continue to enhance  these demonstrated capabilities and provide us with a sustainable advantage  as we advance our business strategy around the world .  please join us in congratulating brian and keith on their new assignments .  mark frevert & dave delainey",0

"Subject: california power 1 / 19 / 00  1 . legislation passes - short - term measures , very long - term measures  as we said yesterday , sb - 7 x passed the california state senate easily . the  bill gives the state the immediate authority to purchase power via the  department of water and resources until february 2 nd . the department will  have $ 400 million available to finance power purchases , but there  expectations that these costs could easily rise to $ 1 billion by next week .  ab - 1 x has evolved into a longer - term solution and in its current form , would  authorize the department of water and resources to enter into long - term  contracts ( as opposed to the 15 day contracts in sb - 7 x ) to buy power at a  price cap of 5 . 5 cents per kw / h . this legislation is not expected to pass  today and will likely be changed considerably during the upcoming two week  period covered by sb - 7 x , when negotiations between generators , the utilities ,  and the state are likely to resume .  a second piece of legislation under - - sb 6 x - - has created uncertainty in the  markets . this legislation will create a california public power authority  with bond issuance authority . the uncertainty concerns whether the new  authority will address the problem of the $ 12 billion in outstanding debt  owed by the utilities . the current text of the legislation focuses only on  longer term measures such as expanding generation capacity and improving  efficiency . yet the legislation also says "" the authority may issue bonds ,  exercise power of eminent domain , and enter into joint power agreements and  buy , own , and sell land and facilities necessary for the financing of a  project . "" the general nature of this language leaves open the possibility of  either issuing bonds to finance past debts , or using eminent domain or the  bond authority to finance the utilities as they enter into a ch . 11 proceeding .  2 . default update  3 . bush  as we reported on wednesday , the bush administration continues to demonstrate  little interest in getting involved",0

"Subject: credit applicatiions in grms  this note is from ted murphy ( not bjorn hagelman )  my understanding is that yet another meeting has been scheduled with the  intent of diverting resources from the grms project to some other project .  while i am not privy to the urgency of this other project , i do know that we  have a very large , multi - phase project going in grms .  grms stands for the global risk monitoring system . it is not intended to be  a commercial trading product not is its primary purpose for commercial  decision - making . conceptually , it is a risk warehouse for the primary  purpose of rac due to the deficiency of current front office trading systems  and their inability to provide timely , aggregated information useful to rac .  rac has spent over a year developing a business plan scope and detailed task  list to accomplish its objectives . as a firm we are woefully behind our  press clippings in our ability to aggregate and understand our risk profile .  my most recent sojorn in europe is a classic example of the current systems  inabilty to aggregate and meet the needs of rac having abetted poor decision  making and causing cash losses in well in excess of the grms budget or that  of the market risk group in rac .  the grms project is a requirement that bill bradford and i have in order to  do our jobs . we have delegated authority to debbie brackett and rudi zipter  to make decisions regarding priorities and as such meet regularly with  jonathon and his team as well as rick buy to provide updates . while progress  is never as fast as we would like it , in every instance in which we have only  to rely on rac , jonathon ' s team and research to make a deadline it haas been  hit . the primary reason for any delays whatsoever has been the diversion of  resources off the project or the reliance for cooperation from some other  source - most recently the it staff in london was a tremendous impediment to  deadlines .  please excuse the frustration that is apparently coming through in this note ,  but i feel like the boy with his finger in the dyke and no one is listening .  also , i have had several employees come to resignation over their frustration  on the lack of management support for this project , usually manifesting  itself in the lack of resources or the diversion of resources devoted to it .  i think we have proven collectively that we can organize a modular multiphase  project and provide tangible deliverables when not distracted . please let us  do our jobs . i do not denigrate the efforts of others , but i believe that  they must either submit their detailed requirements to us for our  consideration of their worthiness to put in our que or develop their own  project with their own resources .  thank you for your consideration of this opinion . as it relates to things  that will effect the ability of market risk to do its job , please consult me  as i would you .  ted",0

"Subject: fw : fyi - more on truck s / d  vince :  i ' d like to send you some articles on the fleet card business .  if you have some time , i ' d like to discuss the meeting that we had with  comdata ( which has a 60 % market share of the fleet card business ) . they have  some live data that potentially could be very interesting ; however , i ' d like  to discuss it with you .  shawn  what a mess ! ( statistical data included )  john d . schulz  03 / 26 / 2001  traffic world  page 25  copyright 2001 gale group inc . all rights reserved . copyright 2001 journal of  commerce , inc .  truckers still waiting for signs of pent - up freight demand ; earnings  shortfalls , layoffs loom  if you are waiting for trucking to kick - start the nation ' s economic recovery ,  pull up a chair and wait awhile . trucking ceos say they haven ' t seen this  slow a first quarter in a decade .  "" perhaps the weakest first quarter for freight demand since swift became a  public company in 1990 , "" phoenix - based swift transportation chairman and ceo  jerry moyes said .  the first - quarter trucking mantra historically has been this : everybody loses  money in january , hopes for a break - even february and earns whatever profit  there is in the quarter in march . that formula may not hold this year .  gregory l . quesnel , president and ceo of con - way transportation services and  emery worldwide parent cnf inc . , said the current slowdown was first detected  late in the third quarter last year and has become "" more pronounced in each  successive quarter . "" march , he said , has been "" as disappointing as the first  two months this year . ""  layoffs already are occurring at the major ltl carriers . yellow freight  system has idled as many as 1 , 000 teamsters and hundreds of white - collar  back - office workers . most large carriers are warning of profit shortfalls  that will cause them to miss analysts ' first - quarter estimates . but there are  deeper fears , too . marginal players may be forced into bankruptcy . small ,  family - owned carriers may be unable to exit the industry on their own terms  because of the shocking decline in the value of used trucks that is causing  some companies to be valued at less than half their worth of just two years  ago .  swift ' s volume drop - off began with shipments originating on the west coast in  january and february and it is continuing in march , moyes said . coupled with  reduced demand from the southwest , moyes said swift will not meet analysts '  first - quarter earnings expectations . swift is not alone .  "" we hauled less freight in february than february a year ago , "" said bob  hammel , executive vice president of pittsburgh - based pitt ohio express , a  leading privately held eastern regional ltl carrier . "" the slowdown in  manufacturing began in the middle of last year and it was precipitous . nobody  anticipated the speed in which manufacturing demand fell off . ""  even con - way , the most profitable ltl operation in the past five years , said  it would have a decline in first - quarter operating income compared with the  year - ago period . con - way ' s tonnage declines were estimated in the  "" mid - single - digit "" percentage range .  roadway express estimated that its current tonnage levels are running 10 to  11 percent below those a year ago , which will result in an approximately  one - half of 1 percent ( 0 . 5 percent ) decline in its operating ratio . ( see  sidebar )  pat hanley , overnite transportation ' s senior vice president and chief  financial officer , said freight figures were flat in february year over year  but rose slightly in march . overnite is the exception to the ltl industry  with as many as 24 new terminals scheduled to be opened this year .  "" january was pretty good to us , but february was flat . it ' s coming back in  march . we ' re probably up in low single digits , 3 to 4 percent . we ' re picking  back up . the economy has hurt us . if you had asked us at the start of the  year , we ' d have said we ' d be up double - digits , "" hanley said .  the national economic picture is "" a big concern , "" hanley said . "" we ' re not  seeing pressure on prices , at least not so far . we ' re seeing customers ship  10 pallets a day instead of 20 . the shipment size is coming down . certainly  we ' re concerned . we ' ll do o . k . , but not as great as we ' d like . ""  forget consumer confidence surveys or the producer pricing index or whatever  stars align in federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan ' s world . the  genuine leading indicator of any national economic trend is trucking , which  is always a first - in , first - out industry in any economic slowdown .  to hear trucking industry leaders tell it , get comfortable with beans and  franks for dinner . it ' s going to be awhile before it ' s filet mignon time  again .  shippers see what ' s happening as well but say it ' s still too early in the  year for carriers to start cutting rates to fill empty trucks .  "" all the carriers we talk with report flat or slightly declining business  levels - - definitely slower than early last year , "" said bill huie , assistant  vice president of corporate transportation for nch corp . , irving , texas .  "" with a couple of exceptions , carriers we talk with have no plans for  expansion in the next few months . we are getting feelers about some possible  lane adjustments to boost revenue . but generally it appears a little early in  the economic downturn for much price movement . ""  the national ltl carriers are seeing the same things . "" our business is down  pretty substantially for the first quarter , "" said roger dick , spokesman for  yellow corp . , parent of yellow freight system and two large regional ltl  carriers , jevic transportation , delanco , n . j . , and saia motor freight ,  duluth , ga .  usfreightways corp . , citing what it called the nation ' s "" serious economic  slowdown , "" said it expects first - quarter earnings to fall "" very substantially  below "" current wall street consensus .  extreme weather conditions also contributed to the already weakened operating  environment , usf chairman , president and ceo samuel k . skinner added .  "" traditionally , the first quarter builds momentum slowly , with march being  the strongest month of the period , "" skinner said in a statement . "" this year ,  the economic slowdown of the fourth quarter of 2000 accelerated in january  and february , softening even the normal modest expectations for those two  months . ""  it ' s not just the ltl industry that ' s hurting . the morgan stanley dean witter  truckload freight index continues to show the worst demand - supply  relationship since analyst james j . valentine began tracking the data in  april 1994 . two events can cause weakness in the index , according to  valentine . they are either an abundance of excess trucks on the road or weak  freight demand .  "" so far in 2001 , we have seen the confluence of both factors , but the  fall - off in demand has far outpaced the increase in supply , "" valentine wrote  in his most recent "" trucking snapshot "" for early march .  year - to - date measurement for truckload demand is down 25 percent year over  year , according to valentine ' s index , while supply is up only 7 percent . that  would indicate the over capacity was a significant issue last year but was  "" masked by the strong economy , "" valentine says .  in a more ominous note , valentine believes overcapacity will continue to  plague the truckload industry for the next one to two years . only a  reaccelerating national economy can bring the demand - supply back in balance  for the truckload sector in the near term , valentine predicts .  the overproduction of new class 8 trucks from early 1998 through early last  year has put too many trucks on the roads and caused supply to back up at  manufacturers , wholesalers and other retailers . used trucks have lost on  average more than 30 percent of their value over the past 18 months .  anecdotally , one used truck dealer , music city truck & equipment , in  lavergne , tenn . , is holding a "" two - for - one "" sale on three - to five - year - old  class 8 freightliners . you can buy two for around $ 30 , 000 , less than a brand  new chevy suburban suv .  what that means is a trucker who bought a 1998 class 8 truck for $ 70 , 000 and  depreciated half the value over three years has a piece of equipment on the  books this year at $ 35 , 000 . but assuming it has lost 30 percent of that  value , it may only be worth $ 24 , 500 in actuality . for a carrier with a  100 - truck fleet , that equates to a loss of more than $ 1 million on assets .  the glut may last for a while , according to valentine ' s analysis . assuming a  three - year trade - in cycle , most of the class 8 tractors in the truckload  sector are just now rolling over to the used - truck market . that means that  overcapacity will plague the truckload industry for at least the next year .  that will result in some of the marginal carriers exiting the business , as  did nearly 1 , 900 carriers last year that either closed or declared  bankruptcy .  "" we can see from indexes , surveys and other information available to us that  it is unlikely there will be any significant improvement in march and freight  demands will continue to be soft throughout the month . based on all of these  factors , we expect usfreightways ' profits for the first quarter to be very  substantially less than published analysts ' forecasts , "" skinner said .  in addition , severe weather conditions including an earthquake in seattle ,  rainstorms in california and blizzards in the northeast have added cost and  decreased efficiencies , skinner added .  expectations at each of usf ' s operating companies have been affected , some  more than others . the ltl , logistics , reverse logistics and  freight - forwarding units are all showing decreased revenue and volume over a  similar period last year , skinner said .  further job cuts at usf worldwide , its freight forwarder , would be in the  offing as cost controls at the unit would be "" accelerated "" in the wake of the  softening economy , skinner said . late last year , skinner said the rebuilding  process at usf worldwide would be a two - year process . but the worsening  economy has made that rebuilding job harder , he said .  "" we are seeing evidence that the slowing economy is , in fact , further  impeding progress in this area , "" skinner said . "" during the fourth quarter of  2000 and continuing into the first quarter of 2001 , the company has taken  steps to increase cost efficiencies . among these actions are a substantial  cutback in capital spending and significant reductions in the labor force .  these cost - control efforts will be accelerated to partially counterbalance  the damaging impact of the current economic and weather conditions . ""  in the 2000 first quarter , usf posted $ 22 . 3 million net income , a 27 percent  rise from the $ 17 . 5 million earnings in the 1999 first quarter . at the time ,  that was usf ' s 15 th straight quarter - over - quarter earnings increase . it came  on $ 608 . 2 million revenue , an 18 . 5 percent rise in from the $ 513 . 2 million  revenue in the 1999 first quarter . analysts had been estimating usf to earn  about $ 3 . 50 a share earnings for 2001 , compared with actual $ 3 . 61 earnings  per share for all of last year . in the fourth quarter last year , usf earned  $ 23 . 7 million , or 91 cents a share .  trucking in a snapshot  market what ' s going on  msdw [ * ] truckload remains in record - low territory , indicating  freight index the worst demand - supply relationship since msdw  began tracking the date in april 1994 .  diesel prices diesel prices in the first quarter of 2001  have come down 6 % sequentially from 4 qo 0 . however ,  the average price for the quarter remains 6 %  above that of lqo 0 .  wti oil opec recently agreed to reduce supply by 5 % and  has stated a price objective of $ 25 per barrel .  capacity retail sales of class 8 tractors ( new trucks  entering the market ) came down in january , but  inventory ( trucks that will enter the market at some  point ) to sales ratio hit a new high of 3 . 4 months  gdp 4 qo 0 gdp increased 1 . 1 % and economists see u . s .  recession in 2001 with + 0 . 5 % and - 1 . 4 % gdp forecast  for lqol and 2 qol , respectively .  retail sales retail sales rose 0 . 7 % in january . while this  was better than forecast , the upside was likely  the result of excessive clearance sales after a  disappointing holiday season .  consumer the conference board ' s measure of consumer  confidence confidence fell again ( nine points ) in february  after registering the largest one - month decline  in 10 years in january ( 14 points ) .  napm the february napm rose slightly to 41 . 9 .  however , it still indicates a contracting  manufacturing sector .  leading the index of leading economic indicators  economic rose 0 . 8 % in january , while  indicator msdw had forecast a 0 . 6 % increase . this  represents the first rise in four months .  stock after a recent pullback , trucking stocks remain  perfonnance up year - to - date with tl stocks up 5 % , regional  ltl stocks up 9 % and national ltl stocks up 13 % .  investor for the week ended february 28 , mutual fund  outflows totaled $ 309 million , compared with  inflows of $ 2 billion in the prior week .  market implications  msdw [ * ] truckload negative for all tl carriers .  freight index  diesel prices the downward trend is positive for all  carriers , especially tl carriers , which have  greater exposure to fuel than ltl carriers .  wti oil negative for all carriers , as $ 25 per  barrel is still 25 % higher than the $ 20 per  barrel average since 1990 .  capacity negative for tl carriers , not a major  concern for ltl carriers , which measure  capacity by the number of terminals .  gdp negative for all carriers .  retail sales negative for both ti and ltl carriers .  consumer negative for all carriers  confidence  napm negative for all carriers .  leading positive for all carriers .  economic  indicator  stock positive , however , stocks could pull  perfonnance back further in the short term as  fundamentals catch up .  investor negative .  source : morgan stanley dean witter research",0

"Subject: alliance info alert : ferc report on western markets  at its special meeting today , ferc released the results of its eagerly  awaited probe into california ' s summer power crisis , concluding that under  certain circumstances , california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and  unreasonable power rates due to california ' s "" seriously flawed "" market  structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions  throughout the west .  the ferc staff report on western markets and the causes of the summer 2000  price abormalities , entitled , part i of staff report on u . s . bulk power  markets , is available at the following website :  in response , ferc issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural  changes to the california iso and px to help remedy the pricing problems , and  solicited public comment by november 22 . a technical conference has also  been scheduled for november 9 , to discuss the proposed solutions and other  remedies that might be suggested ( details tba ) . while all four commissioners  supported the order , the order stretched the commission . chairman hoecker  and comm . breathitt expressed strong endorsements , while comms . hebert and  massey concurred , citing areas where they felt the commission had either  "" over - reached "" or not gone far enough , as discussed below . a final order is  expected to be issued by year ' s end .  at the same time , the commission warned california consumers of their  continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve  state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability of day  ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand responses ; ( 3 )  siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of sufficient  reserve requirements .  highlights of proposed california structural remedy  in its order , ferc proposed a series of market overhauls , including :  ( 1 ) eliminating the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s  investor - owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the px , and allowing  these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other  alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks .  ( 2 ) requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their  transactions in the day - ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for  under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements ) , in  order to discourage over - reliance on the real - time spot market .  ( 3 ) establishing independent , non - stakeholder governing boards for the iso  and px .  ( 4 ) modifying the current single price auction system by ( a ) imposing a  temporary $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap "" that prohibits supply bids in excess of $ 150  from setting the market - clearing price for all bidders ; ( b ) requiring sellers  bidding above $ 150 / mwh to report their bids to ferc on a confidential , weekly  basis and provide certain cost support ; and ( c ) requiring the iso and px to  report monthly information on such bids . the commission ' s price mitigation  measures would remain in effect through december 31 , 2002 .  ( 5 ) declining to order retroactive refunds for the state ' s ratepayers and  utilities , citing insufficient authority to do so , but subjecting sellers to  potential refund liability for transactions from october 2 , 2000 until  december 21 , 2002 , but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs , if  ferc finds non - competitive behavior .  ( 6 ) encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand  response management programs .  separately , the draft order rejected the iso ' s request for an extension of  its current purchase price cap authority , and the px ' s request for price  capping authority .  commissioner responses  comm . herbert reluctantly concurred , noting that his decision may change when  a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at  the november 9 meeting . he stressed that he would have preferred that the  order address four areas : ( 1 ) eliminate all price controls in california  markets ; ( 2 ) abolish the single price auction entirely ; ( 3 ) terminate the  "" buy and sell "" mandate in the px ; and ( 4 ) direct the iso to address a long  list of cited problems in its january 2001 rto filing , rather than having the  commission prescribe specific remedies .  hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the "" soft cap ""  concept , if one had to be adopted , then the soft cap should increase  incrementally increase over time at specific pre - announced dates . he  believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in  facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive  for california regulators to address market design and other flaws . also , he  would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time , but  allow the iso and px to address this issue in their january 2001 rto  filings . in addition , he would not dictate risk management methods ,  preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on  their own . finally , he advised californians not to be so environmentally  focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation  capacity .  comm . breathitt stated her approval of the order while warning that ferc  cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress  towards open and competitive markets . she noted that it was the commission ' s  job to guide the market to self - correct and not to conduct "" command and  control . "" she also commended the managers of the iso and px , saying that  they have performed admirably . however , she noted she is awaiting comments  on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential  reporting requirements .  comm . massey concurred , but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive  approach . he feels that the congress has "" put its thumb on the scale "" in the  federal power act to protect consumers . stating that prices will continue to  be unreasonable in the future , he believes that this order moves in the right  direction , by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over  reliance on the spot market , lack of demand response , the need to  reconstitute governance of the iso and px and the elimination of the buy / sell  mandate . comm . massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the  $ 150 / mwh soft cap went far enough , whether ferc has the legal authority to  issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a  certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market  price volatility .  finally , chairman hoecker stated his strong support of the order , but noted  that this is "" no time to pull punches . "" he emphasized that the commission  needed frank comments from the industry . he echoed comm . breathitt ' s warning  that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on  track . noting that the commission lacked authority to order refunds , he  stated that the responsibility rests with congress . addressing  jurisdictional issues , he stated that siting problems encountered at the  state level are slowing the "" meandering transition "" to competition . he feels  that the state of california and ferc need to work together to resolve these  problems and that ferc is not attempting to usurp power . rather , california  is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region  for reliable energy , thus placing the burden on federal action to make things  work , hoecker maintained . the chairman also said that the commission will  fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further  evidence provided by staff ' s ongoing investigation .  if you have any questions or comments , please call jack cashin at  202 / 508 - 5499 .",0

"Subject: gas prices  vince -  1 . we can detect "" hoarding "" of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against  the actual inflow .  2 . we can detect "" market power "" by dissociating the seller from the buyer ,  distinguishing between the physical "" cost "" in gas to run the generators and  the transmission cost in dollars , i . e . the basis .  3 . ( as you noted ) we can detect "" storage "" as the difference between inflow  and consumption .  it appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model  of gas prices : flow rates at interconnects ( from telemetry ) and spot - market  prices . there is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing  capacity , as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts . the dynamics of gas  prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for  the weather , as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors :  hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas . we can "" calibrate "" the  price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage , and the price  elasticities of demand for transmission , as well as the extent of hoarding ,  from the two sets of numbers mentioned : flows and prices . what the basis  trader needs to understand are the incentives , and disincentives , for storage  and capacity - hoarding , in terms of the calibrated price - elasticities , and  each of these are as - if exotic call options at the consumption hub . finally ,  flows are "" explained "" by the model , and can be imputed from prices if  necessary , resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of  the weather .  i believe the problem is quite tractable , and i would like to proceed with a  model .  clayton",0

( f - pcr ) technology uses live animal blood to detect the presence of infectious diseases and for the development of vaccines for such blood born diseases . it also allows for the efficient , effective , and continuous testing , management and treatment of animal populations . these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today - - all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds . our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals , but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines .  to date , genethera has successfully developed the assay ability to detect mad cow and chronic wasting disease , a disease affecting elk and deer in north america . diagnostic assays for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease are in the final stages of development . vaccines for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease , both of which are diseases affecting cattle , are in advanced stages of development . in the future , the company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases / animals , the immediate targets being mad cow , hoof mouth , west nile and newcastle .  genethera can detect bse using the companies patented live animal blood test that evaluates the e . d . r . f . gene sequence . the e . d . r . f . gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any tse infection is noticeable in a live animal or human . the patent gtha holds is broad based and can detect all tse diseases including mad cow ( bse ) in cattle , cwd in elk deer and creutzfeld - jacobs in humans  the company ' s patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost . the test can also be used on a mass scale using roche f - pcr , dna analyzing robotics equipment . genethera can analyze over 2000 blood samples a day with one f - pcr machine and a single technician . the project will prove highly profitable at approx $ 4 . 00 per test when wide scale commercialization is under way .  a multi - billion dollar , international demand for commercial mad cow testing has emerged around the globe .  japan conducted 3 million post - mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone . they used the western blot developed by prionics ag in swizterland and bio - rad ' s rapid test . costs are between $ 20 and $ 40 dollars per test . most importantly , other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed . testing through post - mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly .  japan spent between $ 60 million - $ 120 million on 3 million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in 2004 .  genethera ' s simple blood test can be collected using their patented field collection system . the sample is then mailed to the lab for testing . the company also stated in their recent 10 k that they are currently in negotiations with strategic testing partners that we believe will absorb the costs of commercializing our live animal mad cow test .  management :  dr . tony milici -

' s or pre - checked plans , that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications  administered by the california department of state architects ( dsa ) .  global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing  educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback  clause . the state of  california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular  classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful  bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities  portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the  originating school district . this process saves school districts  valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids .  a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may  have access to future business for up to five years , depending on  the term of the piggyback contract .  the strategic focus on california schools  since 1998 ,  california legislation has required that at least 20 % of all new  classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures .  there are five compelling reasons for this trend :  modular  classrooms are faster to construct ( as quickly as 2 weeks )  they cost  significantly less ( as low as $ 30 , 000 vs . $ 100 , 000 )  they offer  greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings  they are easier  to finance  they provide  financing incentives  to cope with population growth , the state department of  education estimates that  california will need more than 2 , 500 classrooms each year for the  next four years , which equates to more than 10 , 000 classrooms .  due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout  the california education sector , public and private schools are  expected to turn to portable / modular construction to fulfill their  additional classroom requirements over the next four years .  the california schools budget crisis  on  november 5 , 2002 a $ 13 . 2 billion school facilities improvements bond  proposal ( proposition 47 ) was passed by  california  voters .  this bond measure passage does not include an approximate  $ 9 . 4 billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school  districts throughout the state .  a second bond measure worth $ 12 . 1 billion went before the  voters on the march 2004 .  these bond measures are about three times higher than the  record $ 9 . 2 billion bond  california voters approved in 1998 . the revenue generated from these  bond measures will be used for school modernization programs , which  include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular  classroom construction and renovations .  money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and  private schools ; design upgrades and expand building space at  community colleges and other institutions of higher learning  throughout  california .  gdvi business infrastructure  among global modular ' s asset base is its integrated ,  state - of - the - art , automated manufacturing process which includes  equipment , raw material and marketing collateral that are  specifically designed for the high capacity fabrication of modular  structures .  gdvi employs a workforce of 60 employees and is looking  to add to its workforce as demand increases .  operates out of a sixteen acre site with a 100 , 000 square  foot operating structure .  wholly owned subsidiary ( global modular inc . ) markets ,  designs and manufactures the buildings  wholly owned subsidiary ( mbs corporation ) handles  installation and building renovation .  symbol otc . bb  gdvi  recent price 13 . 5 cents  management team  philip hamilton , ceo and president  mr . hamilton has an extensive and very successful  background in modular manufacturing . from 1996 to feb 2000 he served  as chairman and ceo of pacesetter industries inc . he built this  company from inception into one of  californias  largest manufacturers , producing and installing thousands of schools  and commercial buildings . under his leadership , pacesetter  industries moved into a 5 , 500 , 000 sq . ft . facility in atwater ,  california with branch sales offices throughout the state . the  company employed a staff of over 650 employees and had annual sales  of $ 50 , 000 , 000 .  adam de bard , vice president  mr . de bard has over 6 years of experience in the  manufacturing and business sectors . from 1997 to 2000 he served as  vice president and chief  information officer of pacesetter industries .  ronald kilpatrick , director of finance  mr . kilpatrick has 36 years experience in both domestic  and international development and management of major corporations .  he is a managing partner of pacific rim capital llc which provides  venture capital to projects in the  pacific rim .  recent headlines  global diversified industries , inc . commencing efforts to  increase its u . s . based investor and public relations visibility  pr newswire ( tue 5 : 00 am )  global diversified industries , inc . modular division secures new  order worth more than $ 3 million for immediate delivery  pr newswire ( thu , jun 9 )  wallst . net airing all - new , exclusive audio interviews with gdvi  and geoi  pr newswire ( tue , jun 7 )  wallst . net airing exclusive audio interviews with gdvi and xle  pr newswire ( thu , jun 2 )  global diversified industries , inc . acquires valuable assets  from california modular company  pr newswire ( thu , may 26 )  global diversified industries , inc . modular division  implementing its fourth production line  pr newswire ( thu , may 19 )  talkingstocks . com announces interview with philip hamilton ,  president and ceo of global diversified industries , inc .  primezone media network ( tue , may 17 )  stockguru . com initiates profile coverage of global diversified  industries , inc .  primezone media network ( mon , may 16 )  global diversified industries ' modular division billings total  $ 1 . 4 million in april ;

"Subject: commercialization of nasa technology  hey , i thought you might like to take a look at viaspace  the cohen report  viaspace was founded in 1998 as a spin - off of the caltech / nasa jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) to transform technologies originally developed for space and defense markets into profitable commercial enterprises . viaspace seeks opportunities in high growth markets delivering on problems with growing global relevance by leveraging unique expertise not available elsewhere in the commercial world . viaspace sees a compelling business opportunity in the homeland security public safety and fuel cell markets . viaspace target markets are in excess of $ 100 b / yr and growing with a cagr of over 20 % . in the past six years viaspace has created three companies , spectrasensors , qwip technologies and vialogy corp . their websites provide a background on the commercialization of nasa technology , ( spectrasensors . com , qwip . com , vialogy . com ) . the company ' s current focus is on three subsidiaries , direct methanol fuel cell , arroyo sciences and ionfinity .  direct liquid methanol fuel cell  direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) will provide disposable methanol fuel cell cartridges for tomorrow ' s fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and cell phones . methanol fuel cells ( dfmc ) are expected to replace lithium ion batteries in portable electronic devices . a dfmc can power a laptop for up to 10 hours on a disposable cartridge that costs $ 2 to $ 3 . a smaller cartridge can power a cell phone for up to 3 weeks . we believe consumers will spend a few extra dollars for the convenience of keeping their cell phones and other electronic devices operating . as a disposable product , it generates recurring revenue for dmfcc .  the technology is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents . toshiba , nec , sanyo , and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . dmfcc has opened a tokyo office to work closely with japanese manufacturers .  arroyo sciences , inc .  arroyo focuses on the fusion of radio frequency , nuclear and electromagnetic imaging to deliver information products in transportation , supply chain , security , logistics assurance and first responder safety markets . the micro tracker product enables a wireless tracking for first responders in hazardous environments . this product combines radio frequency identification ( rfid ) tags , wireless digital communications , ground positioning satellite ( gps ) , data for 2 - d and 3 - d geolocation determination , geographic information system ( gis ) and sensor technologies . real - time processing of many high data content inputs is required for the instantaneous assessment of danger . applications include improved safety for fire department personnel in emergency situations , improved coordination of multi - agency deployments and extended operations in hazardous environments .  the cobra product uses the imaging and sensing technology to provide early threat indicators for coastal surveillance and public infrastructure protection such as ports , power plants , airports , and telecommunication facilities . real time sensory and image data is processed and software is customized to discriminate between friend and foe .  deepscan is a software system that provides automatic analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray and gamma ray imaging . arroyo is currently using deepscan for bomb and hazardous material detection in cargo .  ionfinity  ionfinity has developed the next generation mass spectrometry ( ms ) technology that is 10 times more sensitive than existing ms , with a 10 times increase in mass range . higher sensitivity enables the comprehensive monitoring and detection of biological , chemical and nuclear contaminants . the current market for ms is estimated at $ 1 . 2 billion annually . the compact size and rugged portability will expand the market . new applications include enabling port inspection personnel to detect traces of contraband , epa air quality monitoring and assisting in hazardous material clean up .  additional projects under review  projects not included in our forecast are ( 1 ) a water purification technology and ( 2 ) interactive radio . the water purification system displays impressive statistics in that it can convert brackish , sewage or industrial wastewater into ultra - pure water . the water system is scalable from house to municipal usage and will last 25 years while requiring minimal maintenance . the interactive radio enables a listener to receive emails or web sites delivered in response to what is broadcast . the radio station essentially receives input from listeners that could enhance advertising and improve vertical market focus .  forecasts and valuation  we expect revenues for dmfcc will be driven by ( 1 ) increasing wireless usage of computing devices and ( 2 ) the existing need to extend cell phone battery life . we expect revenues for dmfcc will commence in 2007 and grow to $ 195 million by 2009 . homeland security expenditures on airport and seaport security will be a primary revenue driver for arroyo sciences , which will begin to generate revenues in 2005 , and will grow to $ 90 million in 2009 . we expect commercial revenues for ionfinity will commence in late 2007 , and will be $ 10 million in 2009 . beyond 2009 , total revenues will grow at a 60 % to 80 % rate for several years from existing and new products . contracting with existing manufacturers , we expect operating margins will be in the low 40 % range by 2009 . our initial forecasts indicate a fair value range from $ 8 . 40 to $ 11 . 10 based on the projected growth for the 2009 to 2012 timeframe . the graph below outlines our valuation analysis .  directors and management  dr . carl kukkonen , is the ceo and founding partner . dr kukkonen was director for space microelectronics and manager of supercomputing at caltech / jpl , where he worked for 14 years . prior to jpl , dr . kukkonen was the leading expert on hydrogen as alternative fuel at ford motor company .  aj abdallat , coo , and vp of business development has been with viaspace since inception , after working in business development at hewlett - packard and control data corporation .  dr . sandeep gulati has been with viaspace since 2000 . during the prior 12 years , dr gulati was head of the ultracomputing technologies at nasas jpl . dr . gulati is the developer of the revolutionary signal processing technology , qri .  viaspace overview  viaspace was formed in july 1998 with an objective of transforming technologies from caltech / nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory and other advanced technology centers into profitable commercial enterprises through its strong connections with the advanced technology community . through its three subsidiaries - - arroyo sciences , ionfinity , and direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) - - viaspace has a diversified high tech portfolio that includes microelectronics , sensors , homeland security public safety , energy / - fuel cells , information computational technology , rfid , e - finance , and mobile e - commerce .  viaspace develops proven space and defense technologies into hardware and software products that fulfill high - growth market needs and solve today ' s complex problems .  viaspace benefits from important licenses and strategic relationships with caltech / nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory and other universities research laboratories . the viaspace team has a proven expertise for the successful commercialization of innovations in information technology , physical science and life sciences developed at academic research institutions and national laboratories .  the company currently focuses on technologies originally developed for nasa and the us department of defense that have already reached a certain stage of maturity . initial investments in these technologies amount to millions of dollars and many years of rd , enabling viaspace to manage the commercialization process with only a modest additional investment and greatly reduced technical risk .  viaspace couples exceptional technology sourcing and validation capability with a demand - driven process of market validation . decisions about technology transfer and product development are based , first and foremost , on market needs . in addition to our internal expertise , viaspace benefits from the domain expertise of leading experts that serve on our scientific and business advisory boards and from an informal global network of researchers , technology analysts , and technology professionals and investors that would be hard to replicate .  in the last six years , viaspace and its subsidiaries have secured more than $ 30 million in venture financing and strategic investment . initial investors include hewlett packard , divine interventures , los angeles county community development commission , blueprint ventures , the united company , bioprojects international , forrest binkley brown , american river ventures , and nth power .  viaspace has spawned 3 companies : spectrasensors  ( www . spectrasensors . com ) , qwip technologies  ( www . qwip . com ) , and vialogy corp ( www . vialogy . com ) . these companies , currently at various stages of maturity , are positioned within high growth markets and poised for profitability . today , viaspace focuses its effort on its three subsidiaries - - arroyo sciences , ionfinity , and direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) - - and on new high technology opportunities . view full report  view full report  to join market movers mailings press here to find out more .  2400 lincoln ave  altadena , ca 91001  safe harbor statement  this information is a paid advertisement . any views expressed herein are provided for information purposes only and should not be construed as an offer , an endorsement , or inducement to buy or sell securities . bronks communications , inc .

""  i waited patiently . i knew boys like to play . they ' d come to me in  their own time .  on day two , the oldest two were doing summersaults over my lap .  the youngest , ben , took a little longer , but yesterday he raced me  across the yard thirty times and won every time .  the weekend brought back memories of my own childhood . we had  such imaginations . in our minds , a tree was a tower to spot  approaching bad guys , a big rock became a mountain , a fallen log a  space ship headed to the stars . we had toys , but we had to use our  imagination , not like the new toys i see my grandkids with .  our toys didn ' t talk , and if they did , you pulled a string to  make it work . we had blocks to build , crayons to create , trucks and  cars to push . they were simple toys that required imagination . i  thought about the toys in my garage , the ones i saved , when my  children outgrew them . they were simple and needed their imagination  to work . mr . potato head allowed them to learn parts of the body and  giggle at the funny face with an ear where its mouth should have been .  i still have an old plastic phone . it has a dial to turn , a  bell that rings when you push a button , and that ' s it . it doesn ' t  talk , squawk , beep or move around the room . it ' s simple and was used  when they played house , nurse , doctor , and secretary .  i have a toy doctor ' s bag , with all the plastic doctor ' s tools .  i remember all the broken bones , cuts , bangs , scratches and aches my  daughter repaired as i lay in her office moaning .  most toys today do it all . we don ' t need imagination - - it  comes in a box . video games that take us into another world or  reality , talking toys , with vocabularies better than most people ,  computerized toys to teach the alphabet . kids sit and have  imagination brought to them . the teaching toys are great , but  children tire of them - - it ' s like being in school .  when my son was young and tired of his toys , he would come to me  and say , "" dad , i ' m bored . ""  "" go find something to do , "" i ' d reply .  "" i don ' t know what to do . ""  "" go outside and find a friend . ""  "" naaa ! i don ' t want to do that . ""  "" use your imagination . ""  "" huh ? "" he asked .  "" well , when i was young . . . "" you know the routine .  sports is the same . we ' re entertained for hours watching  someone else have fun doing what they ' re good at . wouldn ' t it be  better to be playing yourself ? if we don ' t like the sports available  to watch , we create new ones . it doesn ' t matter what , people will  pay to see it , because they need to be entertained . i haven ' t heard  of world championship worm digging , but if someone offered a large  cash price , people would buy tickets to scream at the contestants .  i worry . are we becoming a society that needs outside influence  to have fun ?  i think i ' ll go climb a tree .  maybe there ' s a pirate ship on the horizon or someone is  attacking my castle .  just imagine .  - - michael t . smith  michael lives in new jersey with his new wife and son .  from our mailbag :  ( in response to last week ' s story , cinderella men )  dear heartwarmers :  last week ' s heartwarming story opened a door to memory lane . i  too , was born in the 30 s and felt some of the poverty of that time .  i remember my mom and dad who never complained of the fatigue that  was so ever present in their lives . we were very fortunate in as  much as we always had plenty of food and warm shelter . we had a  garden and salvaged every edible product available - - even certain  "" weeds "" that were quite tasty after mother got all the spices in  them . i had several beautiful dresses made from feed sacks that i  wore with pride ! we were very poor , but so rich indeed because we  had love and the knowledge that god was upper most in our lives , and  it taught us lessons that had never been printed in the books . i  deeply appreciate those lessons of long ago because they have taught  me how to handle the tough times we have encountered in this life of  prosperity and promise . thank you again for your lovely story . god  bless .  - -  do you enjoy heartwarmers ?

"Subject: a better investment than the stock market .  all our mailings are sent complying to the proposed h . r . 3113 unsolicited  commercial electronic mail act of 2000 . please see the bottom of this  message for further information and removal instructions .  parents of 15 - year old - find $ 71 , 000 cash hidden in  his closet !  does this headline look familiar ? of course it does . you most likely have  just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( usa ) .  and reported elsewhere in the world ( including my neck of the woods -  new zealand ) . his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when  she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried  beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15 - year - old  sons closet . nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when  she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . five - dollar bills , twenties ,  fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber - banded in labelled piles .  "" my first thought was that he had robbed a bank "" , says the 41 - year - old  woman , "" there was over $ 71 , 000 dollars in that bag - - that ' s more than my  husband earns in a year "" .  the woman immediately called her husband at the car - dealership where  he worked to tell him what she had discovered . he came home right away  and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up . little did  they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than  actually finding it in the closet .  as it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via e - mail , a type of  "" report "" to e - mail addresses that he obtained off the internet . everyday  after school for the past 2 months , he had been doing this right on his  computer in his bedroom .  "" i just got the e - mail one day and i figured what the heck , i put my name  on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out "" , says the clever  15 - year - old .  the e - mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one  $ 5 dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top  and move the others addresses down , and finally to add your name to  the top of the list .  the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand  dollars in five - dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your  name at the top of the 5 - address list . "" i get junk e - mail all the time , and  really did not think it was going to work "" , the boy continues .  within the first few days of sending out the e - mail , the post office box  that his parents had gotten him for his video - game magazine subscriptions  began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ 5 bills .  "" about a week later i rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box  had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it . there was also a  yellow slip that said i had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . i thought i  was in trouble or something ( laughs ) "" . he goes on , "" i went up to the  counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . i had to ride back  home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all "" . over  the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the e - mail . "" the  money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the  closet , barely had time for my homework "" . he had also been riding his bike  to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ 5 bills for twenties ,  fifties and hundreds .  "" i didn ' t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks  with like five thousand at a time in my backpack . i would usually tell the  lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the  money ] and he was outside waiting for me . one time the lady gave me a  really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me  and my dad would have to come in and do it , but i just rode to the next  bank down the street ( laughs ) . "" surprisingly , the boy did not have any  reason to be afraid . the reporting news  team examined and investigated the so - called "" chain - letter "" the boy was  sending out and found that it was not a chain - letter at all . in fact , it was  completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws , title 18 ,  section 1302 and 1341 , or title 18 , section 3005 in the us code , also in  the code of federal regulations , volume 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which  state a product or service must be exchanged for money received .  every five - dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read ,  "" please send me report number xyx "" . this simple note made the letter  legal because he was exchanging a service ( a report on how - to ) for a  five - dollar fee .  [ this is the end of the media release . if you would like to understand how  the system works and get your $ 71 , 000 - please continue reading . what  appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -  you can use it too - just follow the simple instructions ] .  be financially free like others within a year ! ! ! before you  say "" bull "" , please read the following . this is the letter you have been  hearing about on the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the  internet , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire  show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really  can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the  program was legal . their findings proved once and for all that there are  "" absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if  people can follow the simple instructions , they are bound to make some  megabucks with only $ 25 out of pocket cost "" .  due to the recent increase of popularity & respect this  program has attained , it is currently working better  than ever .  note * follow the directons below , i had best results the second time when  i hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions .  in order for all of us to be successful , many , many emails must be sent so  that the returns are many . i have been extremely successful using the  following company . they send out the offers , and all i do is accept money  for reports , then i send back to the people as soon as possible .  this is what one had to say : "" thanks to this profitable opportunity . i was  approached many times before but each time i passed on it . i am so glad i  finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal  effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received total  $ 610 , 470 . 00 in 21 weeks , with money still coming in "" .  pam hedland , fort lee , new jersey .  here is another testimonial : "" this program has been around for a long time  but i never believed in it . but one day when i received this again in the  mail i decided to gamble my $ 25 on it . i followed the simple instructions  and walaa . . . . . 3 weeks later the money started to come in . first month i  only made $ 240 . 00 but the next 2 months after that i made a total of  $ 290 , 000 . 00 . so far , in the past 8 months by re - entering the program , i  have made over $ 710 , 000 . 00 and i am playing it again . the key to  success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change  anything .

 remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people  ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment  what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people  mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on  the internet worldwide and counting . believe me , many people will do just  that , and more !  method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet  advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of  free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will  easily get a larger response .  we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as  you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the  report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all  orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out with your name  and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they  receive the report .  = order each report by its number & name only . notes : always  send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not  accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2  sheets of paper or aluminum foil . on one of those sheets of paper , write  the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail  address and your name and postal address .  place your order for these reports now :  report # 1 : the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net  order report # 1 from :  r . r .  po box 18048  chicago , il 60618  report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk e - mail on the net  order report # 2 from :  gm boland  353 jonestown rd . suite 125  winston salem , nc 27104  report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net  order report # 3 from :  r . chernick  po box 771661  c . s . florida 33077  report # 4 : how to become a millionaire utilizing mlm & the net  order report # 4 from :  m . eiseman  po box 451971  sunrise , florida 33345 - 1971  report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free  order report # 5 from :  l . samon  po box 31  castletown  isle of man  im 99 5 xp  $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $  follow these guidelines to guarantee your success :  + + + if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks ,  continue sending e - mails until you do . = orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for  report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until  you do .  + + + once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can  relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will  continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time  your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different  report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which  report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate  more income send another batch of e - mails and start  the whole process again . there is no limit to the income you  can generate from this business ! ! !  following is a note from the originator of this  program : you have just received information that can give you  financial freedom for the rest of your life , with no risk and just a  little bit of effort . you can make more money in the next few  weeks and months than you have ever imagined . follow the program  exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works  exceedingly well as it is now .  remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your  name and address in report # 1 and moved others to # 2 thru # 5 as  instructed above . one of the people you send this to may send out  100 , 000 or more e - mails and your name will be on every one of them .  remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers  you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information ,  materials and opportunity to become financially independent .  it is up to you now !

""  with network marketing you have two sources of income . direct  commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from  sales made by people you introduce to the business .  residual income is the secret of the wealthy . it means investing  time and money once , and getting paid again and again and again .  in network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of  others .  the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my  fingers . fortunately , sometime later i reread everything and gave  some thought and study to it .  my name is jonathan rourke . two years ago , the corporation i  worked at for the past twelve years down - sized and my position  was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to  open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many  unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and  creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my  business and i just couldn ' t seem to make ends meet . i had to  refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and  struggling business . at that moment something significant happened  in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that  this will change your life forever financially ! ! !  in mid december , i received this program via e - mail . six month ' s  prior to receiving this program , i had been sending away for  information on various business opportunities . all of the programs  i received , in my opinion were not cost effective . they were  either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial  investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work  or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one  year . it didn ' t tell me i ' d have to write a book to make it !  but like i was saying , in december i received this program . i  didn ' t send for it , or ask for it ; they just got my name off a  mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! !  after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it  correctly , i couldn ' t believe my eyes .  here was a money making phenomenon .  i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me  further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it  out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i  was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal  aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office  ( 1 - 800 - 725 - 2161 24 hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed  legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain  letter , i decided "" why not . ""  initially i sent out 10 , 000 e - mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my  time on - line . the great thing about e - mail is that i don ' t need  any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of  my orders are filled via e - mail , the only expense is my time . i am  telling you like it is . i hope it doesn ' t turn you off , but i  promised myself that i would not ' rip - off "" anyone , no matter how  much money it cost me .  here is the basic version of what you need to do :  your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for report # 1  within 2 weeks of your first program going out . if you don ' t , send  out more programs until you do .  your second goal is to receive at least 150 + orders for report # 2  within 4 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do .  once you have your 150 orders , relax , you ' ve met your goal . you  will make $ 50 , 000 + but keep at it ! if you don ' t get 150 right off ,  keep at it ! it may take some time for your down line to build .  keep at it , stay focused , and do not let yourself get distracted .  in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report  # 1 . i kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by january 13 ,  1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . my first step in making  $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was done .  by january 30 , 1 had received 196 orders for report # 2 ; 46 more  than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my  e - mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every  day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car .  please take time to read the attached program , it will change your  life forever ! ! remember , it won ' t work if you don ' t try it . this  program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the  rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it  won ' t work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money !  in order for this program to work very fast , try to meet your goal  of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 150 + orders for report # 2 and you  will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . if you don ' t reach the first  two goals with in four weeks , relax , you will still make a ton of  money , it may take a few months or so longer . but keep mailing out  the programs and stay focused ! that ' s the key . i am living proof  that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program ,  i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or  risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and  you will be on your way to financial security .  if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble  like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this  a sign . i did ! - sincerely , jonathan rourke  p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look  like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome !  a personal note from the originator of this program :  by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you  should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal ,  could not have been created by an amateur .  let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business  for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was  doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but  it wasn ' t working .  finally , i figured it out . it wasn ' t me ; it was the economy .  inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had  been with us since 1945 .  i don ' t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment  rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there  were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before .  the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were  doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not including  those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down  into the ranks of the poor .  as the saying goes , ' the rich get richer and the poor get poorer .

 to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5  reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing  information which includes how to send bulk e - mails , where to find  thousands of free classified ads and much , much more .  here are two primary methods of building your downline :  method # 1 : sending bulk e - mail  let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes ,  and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000  programs each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 %  response . using a good list , the response could be much better .  also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs  instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out  only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders  for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000  programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people  respond and order report # 2 .  those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the  0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000  send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 %  response to that is i 0 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that amounts to  10 , 000 each of $ 5 bills for you in cash money ! then think about  level five ! that ' s $ 500 , 000 alone !  your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000  + $ 500 , 000 for a total of $ 555 , 550 ! ! !  remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people  you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program !  dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half  sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many  people will do just that and more !  report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e - mailing , and  e - mail software .  method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet  1 . advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive , and there are  hundreds of free places to advertise . let ' s say you decide to  start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to  get only 10 people to participate on your first level . placing a  lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response .  also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10  downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering  results below : lst level - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . $ 50  2 nd level - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . $ 500  3 rd level - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000  4 th level - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 k ) . . . . . . . $ 50 , 000  5 th level - 10 members from those 10 , 000 ( $ 5 x 100 k ) . . . . . . . $ 500 , 000  this totals - $ 555 , 550  remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate  only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen  if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 ' s of  participants .  think about it ! for every $ 5 . 00 you receive , all you must do is  e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide  same - day service on all orders !

"Subject: info you requested kcc  thank you for your interest !  judgment coursesoffers an extensive training  course in "" how to collect moneyjudgments ""  if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a  money judgment is and why processing money judgments  can earn you very substantial income .  if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you  will have a money judgment against them .  you are happy you won but you will soon find out the  shocking fact : its now up to you to collect on the  judgment . the court does not require the loser to pay you .  the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser  down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts ,  real estate , stocks and bonds , etc .  very few people know how to find these assets or what to do  when they are found . the result is that millions of  judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten .  in 79 % of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a  dime .  the non - payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic  proportions . right now in the united states there is  between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedmoney  judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more  judgments take its place .  we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have  actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this  business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid  profession in which only a select few will be trained in the  techniques necessary to succeed .  with our first hand experience we have built a course which  teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown  and exciting field of processing money judgments .  by following the steps laid out in our course and with  reasonable effort you can become very successful in the  processing of money judgments .  the income potential is substantial in this profession . we  have associates who have taken our course and are now  working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per  year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00  and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operateout of  their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable  organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business  offices .  today our company and our associates have over 126  million dollars in money judgments that we are currently  processing . of this 126 million , 25 million is in the form  of joint ventures between our firm and our associates .  joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break  even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on  the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting  capability is so extensive that government agencies , police  officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . , all come to us  for reports .  many of our associates already have real estate liens in  force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars .  legally this means that when the properties are sold or  refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 %  interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments .  annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to  $ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the  payment of the principal .  our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per  year . this is just for interest , not counting principle  and not counting the compounding of the interest which can  add substantial additional income . typically companies are  sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest  an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell  their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars .  92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 %  are women and 36 % are part time .  one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are  not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off  for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are  working on will be there when you return . the judgments  are still in force , they do not disappear .  the way we train you is non - confrontational . you use your  computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you  never confront the debtor . the debtor doesn ' t know who you  are . you are not a collection agency .  simply stated the steps to successful money processing  are as follows :  mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals  with money judgments . ( we train you how to find out who  to write to )  8 % to 11 % of the firms and people you write will call you  and ask for your help . they call you , you don ' t call them  unless you want to .  you send them an agreement ( supplied in the course ) to  sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 % to you and  50 % to them . this applies no matter if the judgment is for  $ 2 , 000 . 00 or $ 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 .  you then go on - line to our computers to find the debtor  and their assets . we offer over 120 powerful reports to  assist you . they range from credit reports from all three  credit bureaus , to bank account locates , employment  locates , skip traces and locating stocks and bonds , etc .  the prices of our reports are very low . typically 1 / 2 to  1 / 3 of what other firms charge . for example we charge  $ 6 . 00 for an individuals credit report when some other  companies charge $ 25 . 00 .  once you find the debtor and their assets you file  garnishments and liens on the assets you have located .  ( standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the  course )  when you receive the assets you keep 50 % and send 50 % to  the original judgment holder .  once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of  judgment to the court . ( included in the course )  quote ' s from several of our students :  thomas in area code 516 writes us : "" i just wanted to drop  you a short note thanking you for your excellent course . my  first week , part time , will net me 3 , 700 . 00 dollars . your  professionalism in both the manual and your support .  you have the video opened doors for me in the future .  there ' s no stopping me now . recently thomas states  he has over $ 8 , 500 , 000 worth of judgments he is working on ""  after only having this course for four months , larry s . in  area code 314 stated to us : "" i am now making $ 2 , 000 . 00 per  week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the  next year . i am having a ball . i have over $ 250 , 000 in  judgments i am collecting on now ""  after having our course for 7 months larry s . in 314 stated  "" i am now making $ 12 , 000 . 00 per month and have approximately  $ 500 , 000 . 00 in judgments i am collecting on . looks like i  will have to hire someone to help out ""  marshal in area code 407 states to us "" i feel bad , you only  charged me $ 259 . 00 for this course and it is a goldmine . i  have added 3 full time people to help me after only having  your course for 5 months ""  > from the above information and actual results you can see  why we can state the following :  with our course you can own your own successful business .  a business which earns you substantial income now and one  which could be sold in 3 - 5 years , paying you enough to  retire on and travel the world . a business which is  extremely interesting to be in . a business in which every  day is new and exciting .  none of your days will be hum - drum . your brain is  challenged . a business , which protects you from corporate  downsizing . a business which you can start part time from  your home and later , if you so desire , you can work in full  time . a business , which is your ticket to freedom from  others telling you what to do . a business , which lets you  control your own destiny . our training has made this happen  for many others already . make it happen for you !  if the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you  to talk to a real live human being , no cost or obligation  on your part .  please call us at 1 - 281 - 500 - 4018 .  we have service support staff available to you from 8 : 00 am to  10 : 00 pm ( central time ) 7 days a week . if you callthis number  you can talk to one of our experienced customer support personnel .  they can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation .  sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations  of courses . when you call our customer support line they can let  you know of any specials we may be running . if you like what you  read and hear about our courses , then the customer support person  can work with you to place your order . we are very low key . we  merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to  work with us or not .  thank you for your time and interest .  + + + + +  this ad is produced and sent out by :  uas  to be excluded from our mailing list please email us at eds @ saiyan . com with "" exclude "" in the sub - line .  or write us at : adminscript - update , p o b 1 2 0 0 , o r a n g e s t a d , a r u b a  + + + + + +  5 ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' to 48 5 - 28 c 30 p  - sspltm - 30 ",1

( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ?  recently ,  we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and  how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the  next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could  have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all  over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became  obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to  bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics .  merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the  potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another  source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this  business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the  single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online  gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be  an ideal time to is time to invest .  we decided to  find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with  a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging ,  publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a  close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months .  although  ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at  the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old .  the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno .  and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the  keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it  gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream  gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online  gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers  these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the  company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in  the investment community and driving up its stock price .  after a successful north american launch ,  gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese  and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business  decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest  source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach .  what  does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game ,  one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced  management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . .  to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more .  first source data inc .  4535 west sahara ave # 217  las vegas nevada 89102  disclosure and disclaimer  investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first  source data , inc .

"Subject: partnership  mr . edward moko  18 independence close ,  johannesburg ,  south africa .  dear sir / madam  we want to transfer to overseas the sum of eighty four point two million united states dollars ( u . s . $ 84 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) from a bank in africa .  i want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank account immediately to receive this money , though an empty bank account could serve this purpose as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing in god that you will never let me down either now or in time to come .  i am mr . edward moko . the external auditor of a bank . during the course of our auditing , i discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1998 and since 2001 nobody has operated on this account gain . after going through some old files in the records , i discovered that the owner of the account died without a "" heir apparent to the throne "" hence the money is floating and if i do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing . the owner of this account who is mr . eshed . b . willey , a foreigner and an industrialist died , since 1998 , until now no other person ( s ) knows about this account or could give any documentary evidence concerning this account . as such this account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that eshed . b . willey until his death was the manager oriental diamond company , in south africa . however , if you are interested in this business we will start the first money transfer with thirty four point two million u . s . dollars ( u . s . $ 34 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) upon successful transaction without any disappointment from you . we shall also re - apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account . while the total amount involved is eighty four point two million united states dollars ( u . s . $ 84 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) only . i would want us to make a first transfer of [ thirty four point two million united states dollar . u . s . $ 34 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest . i am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local account , without valid international foreign "" agreement "" , but could only be approved to any foreigner with valid international credentials : passport or drivers license and foreign account because this sum is in u . s . dollars and the former owner of the account mr . eshed . b . willey is a foreigner too , thus the money could only be approved into a foreign account . however , knowing all this , we will reach a binding agreement in this regards .  as a matter of urgency , i will inform you the next step to take , while you send your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit . i want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to any account of your choice where the fund will be safe . before we fly to your country for withdrawal , sharing and investments , i need your full co - operation to make this business a success , because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account , which i will give to you , upon your positive response and once i am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with the instructions of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business . i need your strong assurance that you will never let me down . with my influence and the position in the bank we can transfer this money to any foreigner ' s reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing . and to build confidence that you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which i will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account . i will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately i hear from you that you are ready to act as directed . to prove the authenticity of the business i will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries , foreign exchange departments , embassy and board of internal revenue services . at the conclusion of this business , you will be given 35 % of the total amount , 60 % will be for me , while 5 % will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during this process .  i look forward to your earliest reply through my email address .  respectfully  mr . edward moko .",1

that ' s why i went  into this thing !  thank ' s to the computer age and the internet !  be an internet millionaire like others within a year ! ! !  before you say ' ' bull ' ' , please read the following . this is the letter you have been hearing  about on the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a national  weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program  described below , to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated  whether or not the program was legal .  their findings proved once and for all that there are ' ' absolutely no laws prohibiting the  participation in the program and if people can "" follow the simple instruction "" they are  bound to make some mega bucks with only $ 25 out of pocket cost ' ' .  = = print this now for your future reference = =  if you would like to make at least $ 500 , 000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably ,  please read the following . . . then read it again and again ! ! !  follow the simple instruction below and  your financial dreams will come true , guaranteed !  instructions :  = = = = = order all 5 reports shown on the list below = = = = =  for each report , send $ 5 cash , the name & number of the report you are  ordering and your e - mail address to the person whose name appears on  that list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your  envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems .  = = = when you place your order , make sure = = =  = = = you order each of the 5 reports ! = = =  you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them .  your total cost $ 5 x 5 = $ 25 . 00 .  within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the 5 reports from these 5 different  individuals . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the  1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . also make a floppy of these reports and  keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer .  important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report ,  or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in step ' ' 1  through 6 ' ' or you will loose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the  way this works , you will also see how it does not work if you change it .  remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work ! ! ! people  have tried to put their friends / relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the  money . but it does not work this way . believe us , some have tried to be greedy and then  nothing happened . so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed .  because if you do , it will not work for you . remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! !  this is a legitimate business . you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it .  treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time .  1 . . after you have ordered all 5 reports , take this advertisement and remove the name  & address of the person in report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and  is no doubt counting their fortune .  2 . . move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5 .  3 . . move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4 .  4 . . move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3 .  5 . . move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2  6 . . . . insert your name & address in the report # 1 position .  please make sure you copy every name & address accurately ! this is critical  to your success .  take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do  not make any other changes .  save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data . to assist you with  marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with  invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where  to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to  get this venture going :  method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally  let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you  and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing  receive only a 0 . 2 % ( 2 / 10 of 1 % ) response ( the response could be much better but lets  just say it is only 0 . 2 % ) . also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands e - mails  instead of only 5 , 000 each ) .  continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response ,  that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e -  mail each for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with  orders . that ' s = 100 people responded and ordered report # 2 .  those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 %  response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 .  those 1000 people send 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 5 million e - mail sent out . the  0 . 2 % response is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 .  those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e -  mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 .  that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half a million dollars ) .  your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . .  $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . .  grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00  numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst  possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you will  still make a lot of money !  remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of  5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or  half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ?  there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands  more coming on line every day . believe me , many people will do just that , and more !  method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet  advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places  to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we  strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for  every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it .  always provide same day service on all orders .  this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will  be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report .  = = = = = = = = = = = available reports = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  the reason for the "" cash "" is not because this is illegal or somehow "" wrong "" . it is simply  about time . time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc . concealing it  is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to  you .  order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5  cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is  concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper ,  write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail  address and your name and postal address .  place your order for these reports now :  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = report # 1 : ' the insider ' s  guide to advertising for free on the net  order report # 1 from :  y . l . wong  p . o . box no . 71819  kowloon central post office  hong kong  report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk email on the net  order report # 2 from :  martin veronneau  c . p . 70058  laval , quebec  h 7 r 5 z 2  canada  report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net  order report # 3 from :  francis kidd  p . o . box 209  homestead , pa 15120  usa  report # 4 : how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net  order report # 4 from :  m . l . frayser  p . o . box 61432  fort myers , fl 33906  usa  report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free  order report # 5 from :  stone evans  600 n . pearl , suite gl 03  dallas , tx 75201  usa  $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $  follow these guidelines to guarantee your success :  = = = if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue  sending e - mails until you do .  = = = after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100  orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails  until you do .  * * once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because  the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is  important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are  placed in front of a different report .  you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are  ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another  batch of e - mails and start the whole process again . there is no limit  to the income you can generate from this business ! ! !  following is a note from the originator of this program :  you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your  life , with no risk and just a little bit of effort . you can make more money in  the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined . follow the program  exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as  it is now .  remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and  address in report # 1 and moved others to # 2 . . . . . # 5 as instructed above . one of the  people you send this to may send out 100 , 000 or more e - mails and your name will be on  every one of them .  remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach .  so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to  become financially independent .  it is up to you now !

"Subject: urgent response  dear sir / madam ,  you may be surprised to receive this letter from me , since you don ' t know me personally . i am mrs maria da costa the wife of dr . john da costa , who was recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe , i got your contact through network on line in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of a fund to a foreign account and i decided to write you . my late husband was among the zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president robert mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority . before his death he deposited the sum of us $ 15 . 2 million ( fifteen million two hundred thousand us dollars ) to south africa with a security company as if he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe .  the money was deposited in a din box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the security company . this money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and establishment of new farms in lesotho and swaziland . the land problem arose when president robert mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the "" modus operandi "" adopted by the government .  this resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs , precisely ; more than fifty - one ( 51 ) people have so far been killed . heads of governments from the west , especially britain and united states of america have voiced their condemnation of mugabe ' s plan , subsequently , south african development community ( s . a . d . c . ) has continuously supported mugabe ' s new land act , it is against this background that i and my  family who are currently residing in south africa have decided to transfer my husband ' s money into a foreign account . as a family , i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account , where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who is tactically freezing of our family wealth .  and south africa ' s government seems to be playing along with them . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in south africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history . more so , the south african foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an "" asylum "" . as a business person whom i would entrust my future and that of my family into his hands , i must let you know that this transaction is 100 % risk free and that the nature of your business does not necessarily matter .  for your assistance , i will offering you 15 % of the total sum , 80 % for my family while 5 % will be mapped out for any expenses we may incur during the course of this transaction . i wish to  invest our part of the money on commercial property based on your advice .  finally , all i demand from you is assurance that you will not do away with this money when it finally gets to your personal or company ' s account in your country .  if this proposal is acceptable by you , please confirm your interest by contacting us on this phone number + 27724263169 or e - mail address mariadacosta _ 2002 @ yahoo . com  best regards ,  mrs maria da costa ( for the family )",1

( popt ) and roxxy corporation announced that the  companies have entered into a letter of intent whereby roxxy corporation will  acquire a 66 % interest in pop 3 ' s wholly owned subsidiary , viastar  distribution group , inc . "" vdg , "" forming a revolutionary new music company ,  controversial entertainment corporation . the transaction , consisting of  stock and cash , when completed , will provide pop 3 ' s shareholders with a  33 % stake in the new company .  roxxy ' s management will operate the company from headquarters in los  angeles and will change its corporate name to controversial entertainment  corporation in the coming weeks . the companies intend to complete and  execute the definitive agreement by july 8 th , 2005 , and seek shareholder  approval immediately thereafter .  pop 3 ' s ceo , john d . aquilino , stated , "" this alliance will allow pop 3 to  achieve its strategic vision of creating a new paradigm in the music  industry . one that is focused on supporting the artist and the music they  create while embracing emerging technologies and giving consumers  access to a variety of artists through a variety of media . ""  roxxy ' s management team combines highly experienced industry executives  drawn from the major labels and also includes a staff of in - house  producers who are among the most influential talents in the music industry  today .  "" it is roxxy ' s vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major  labels ' lack of commitment to their artists and customers ; labels that  cast aside established artists who can no longer generate multi - million  selling recordings , but who consistently release albums which sell  hundreds of thousands of records to a large and loyal fan base ; artists  that can easily generate revenues between $ 1 and $ 5 million per title , ""  stated john shebanow , roxxy ' s ceo .  "" additionally , the acquisition of vdg will provide us with the ability  to distribute our own product directly to retail to over 22 , 000 retail  location in north america , effectively doubling the company ' s net  profit margins and allowing the increased revenue to pass on to our  artists . ""  mr . shebanow concluded , "" while there are smaller labels that do provide  a home for these acts , they lack either the will or financial resources  to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the caliber we have  on staff require . and no company has the unique combination of great  producers , in - house distribution and dedication to the artist and the  customer that controversial entertainment will possess . ""  about pop 3 media corp :  pop 3 media corp . is engaged in development , production and distribution  of entertainment - related media for film , television , music and  publishing interests . the company ' s portfolio currently includes ownership of  viastar distribution group , a . v . o . studios , moving pictures  international , viastar records , quadra records , light of the spirit records , and  viastar classical , viastar artist management group and masterdisk  corporation .  conclusion :  the examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known  companies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are  already familiar with this . is popt poised and positioned to do that for  you ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch  this one trade wednesday ! go popt .  penny stocks are considered highly speculative and may be unsuitable  for all but very aggressive investors . this profile is not in any way  affiliated with the featured company . we were compensated 3000 dollars  to distribute this report . this report is for entertainment and  advertising purposes only and should not be used as investment advice .  if you wish to stop future mai - lin * gs , or if you feel you have been  wrongfully placed in our membership , send a blank e mail with no thanks in  the sub ject to no _ morenewsletters 2 @ yahoo . com",1

"Subject: capital hill gold - chgi - potential high grade gold deposit  breaking news : denver , june 14 , 2005 ( business wire ) - - capital hill gold , inc , ( chgi ) reports that the company ' s geologists are evaluating a potential high - grade bulk - tonnage gold deposit located in mineral county , nevada , the project is situated in the vicinity of several operating and past - producing gold mines , including the paradise peak , santa fe and rawhide deposits , after review of usgs geochemical survey work of the project and a study of the geology of other gold deposits in the area , geologists believe that the target would be a high - grade bulk - tonnage gold deposit ,  virgin deposits : the privately - held 440 - acre project was originally staked by a major gold mining company in the 1990 s , the property has never been drilled and may prove to be a rich vein as early tests have indicated , follow - up work by the company ' s geologist indicated that a major international gold mining company had staked approximately 200 unpatented lode - mining claims in the area during 2001 and 2002 ,  geologists investigating the property for capital hill observed multiple broad zones of silicification extending for considerable distances , samples were collected from several outcrops on the property , and have been submitted to american assay labs in elko , nevada for assaying , based on positive assay results , target and identification , a major claim - staking program will be launched accordingly , as further credible evidence emerges of a significant gold ore deposit , and the first results coming in are showing promise ,  on june 13 , 2005 the company announced in a press release that capital hill ' s management is pleased and encouraged with the first u 3 o 8 ( uranium oxide ) assay returns as well as the noticeable precious metal results and that initial reconnaissance sampling on the company ' s uranium project has returned assays grading 0 , 061 % u 3 o 8 to 0 , 068 % u 3 o 8 of great interest to the company is the fact that the samples taken also assayed positively for precious metals , with results ranging from 0 , 08 to 0 , 22 oz ag / st and trace amounts of gold , the occurrence of silver in conjunction with the uranium mineralization warrants further investigation .  the recent news of the company possibly sitting on a huge untapped gold deposit has the stock in a strong up trend , rallying from 5 cents to 75 cents during the past three months . as the three - month chart illustrates , trading volume has swelled to 300 , 000 shares per day with money flow indicators showing strong inflows , which is representative of a stock that is under accumulation . the positive tape action clearly shows strong investor sentiment about the company ' s leverage on controlling sizable parcels of gold fields . the potential recoverable gold data has yet to be compiled , but as mentioned above , early tests are very promising , which is why investors are bidding up shares ahead of this data .  capital hill gold ' s strategic objective is to obtain controlling interests in properties with excellent exploration potential to become economically significant to world - class ore deposits . chgi intends to acquire mineral exploration properties primarily through the filing of concessions on its own account and in partnership as well as by optioning exceptional properties at reasonable costs relative to the property ' s potential and the financial capabilities of the company .  in recent weeks , chgi shareholders have been on the receiving end of some very promising developments with the new discoveries for gold ore . in addition , the company is aggressively exploring for commercial grade uranium deposits that will supply newly heightened demand from nuclear utilities . since 2003 uranium prices have doubled . 20 % of the world ' s electricity comes from uranium , and the nuclear power plant count is stable and growing . the united states needs to add about 100 nuclear power plants over the next two decades to meet burgeoning demand for electric power and maintain the current generating mix , nils j . diaz , chairman of the u . s . nuclear regulatory commission told reporters in early may 2005 .  as of may 17 , 2005 the company is pleased to report that the claim staking crew and geologist have arrived on site , and have begun staking claims . the area being staked encompasses a large area of potentially commercial - grade uranium mineralization identified by previous work , including geophysical surveys . reconnaissance sampling of the ground being staked has returned assay results approximately equal to those of in - place resources at one of the past - producing uranium mines in the project area .  a chinese news web site reports that china , the world ' s second - largest energy consumer after the u . s . , will spend 400 billion yuan ( u . s . $ 48 . 33 billion ) on building new nuclear power plants by 2020 . this is a bigger number than we have seen in the past . the energy - hungry country intends to increase the amount of installed nuclear power capacity from the current 16 gigawatts to 40 gigawatts within 15 years . nuclear power generation is expected to triple to reach 60 gigawatts by that time . so the market for uranium is in a new bull market .  conclusion  development efforts for gold and uranium on chgi properties are about to commence following the better - than - expected geophysical testing results . shares of chgi have rallied over 10 - fold in just the past three months in anticipation of what the future holds in the way of extractible gold and uranium . once full mining operations are under way , it is our view , that the shares will rally as the business generates its initial revenue stream .  for additional information , visit  investor relations solutions is a communications arm of ir solutions profiles . investor relations solutions is not licensed by any governmental or regulatory agencies and is not a registered investment advisor , financial planning service or a stock brokerage firm and in accordance with such , investor relations solutions is not offering investment advice or promoting any investment strategies . investor relations solutions is not offering securities for sale or solicitation of any offer to buy or sell securities . this stock advertisement or e -

operation to enable us achieve our goal , and not a  perfidious person . on the 6 th of may , 2002 it was reported to us that my  client , his wife and their only daughter were involved in a local plane  crash at kano state , enroot abuja ( the capital city ) all occupants in the  plane lost their lives , unfortunately on this same flight were other  dignitaries like the sports minister and a host of others  meanwhile , until his death , my late client had a fixed deposit account of  usd $ 15 . million deposited in a security company ( unic security company )  here . recently , i received an ultimatum from the security company asking me  to provide my late client ' s relative so that the money would be given to  them . but unfortunately it was discovered that my late client did not  declare any identifiable family member in all the official documents he  tendered to the security company while opening the account .  therefore , this development leaves me as the only person with the full  picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit my  late client made and who is entitled to be the bona fide beneficiary / next of  kin or relative because he died intestate . therefore , if i fail to locate  any of his relatives or his next of kin ( and have this money transferred to  them ) the security company will at the expiration of the 6 weeks ultimatum  given to me confiscate the account .  according to the ultimatum issued to me by the security company , if i fail  to present to them my late client ' s relative , with a legitimate statement of  claim for the money before the given time they will confiscate the account  and the money declared ' unclaimed balance ' . this will result in the money  being taken over by the security company . this will not happen if i have my  way .  since i have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives of my late client  all these while , my proposal , therefore , is to present you as the next of  kin / relative of my client due to the fact that you are a foreigner and can  easily pass as a possible relative of my client . i know you will be  wondering how possible this could be but i assure you that this is simple .  i therefore seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to my client  so that the money he deposited with the security company would be paid to  you and there after you and i will share the money 40 % for you and i will be  taking 60 % . i assure you that the deposit would be released to you within a  few days because i have all the relevant information that would facilitate  that will be required on documentation .  first , i will like you to provide immediately the following information :  your full names .  contact address .  telephone / fax numbers .  with this information i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavit  that will put you in place as the next of kin . after we have successfully  satisfied the requirements of the bank the money totaling usd 15 . million  would be paid into your account for you to take 40 % and i will be taking  60 % . all i require is your honest co - operation to enable us see this  through .  there is no risk at all because everything would be done legally and my  position as a qualified attorney will facilitate everything . secondly , i  will give you all the necessary documents that would serve as evidence  proving that you are the next of kin / relative of my late client . these  documents will legally conferm on you the status to act as the beneficiary  of the estate of my late client .  what i related to you might smack of unethical practice but i want you to  understand that this is a once in life time opportunity capable of turning  around our situation . the truth is that this money would not be taken by the  government but by some greedy security company officials and i would not  fold my arms and watch this happen hence my decision to contact you .  if you are interested in doing this transaction with me kindly send your  reply to this email address : ( arismanshonikon @ shymail . com )  thank you as i await your positive response .  barr . arisman shonikon .",1

"Subject: urgent contact  from the desk of : dr tom eke .  e - mail : dr _ tomeke @ spinfinder . com  lagos - nigeria .  attn :  request for urgent business relationship .  it is with my profound dignity that i write you this  very important  and highly confidential letter . first , i must  solicit your strictest  confidentiality in this transaction . this is by  virtue of its nature  as being utterly confidential and "" top secret "" .  though i know that a  transaction of this magnitude will make any one  apprehensive and  worried , considering the fact that we have not met  each other before ,  but i am assuring you that all will be well at the  end of the day . we  have decided to contact you by email due to the  urgency of this  transaction , as we have been reliably informed that  it will take at  least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal  post to reach you ,  so we decided it is best using the e - mail , which is  quicker and also  to enable us meet up with the second quater payment  for the year  2000 .  however , let me start by introducing myself properly  to you . i  am dr . tom eke , a director general in the department  of petroleum  resources ( d . p . r ) and i presently head the contract  award panel incharge  of contract awards and payment approvals . i came to  know of you in my search for a reliable and  reputable person to  handle a very confidential business transaction  which involves the  transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account  requiring  maximum confidence . i and my colleagues are top  officials of the  federal government contract award panel . our duties  include evaluation , vetting , approval for payment of  contract jobs  done for the d . p . r e . t . c . in order to commence this  business we  solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer  into your account  the said funds . the source of this funds is as  follows : in the second  quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to  review and award  contracts to the tune of us $ 400 million us dollars  to a group of five  firms for the supply construction and installation  of oil pipe lines  in warri and port harcourt . during this process my  colleagues and i  decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately  over - inflate the  total contract sum from us $ 400 million to us $ 431  million united  states dollars with the main intention of sharing  the remaining sum  of us $ 31 miilion amongst ourselves .  the federal government of nigeria has since the  second quater of  year 2001 approved the sum of us $ 431 million for us  as the contract sum ,  and the sum of us $ 400 million has also been paid to  the foreign companies  concerned as contract entitlements for the various  contracts done , but  since the companies are entiltled to us $ 400 million  dollars only , we are  now left with us $ 31 million dollars balance in the  account which we intend to  disburse amongst ourselves , but by virtue of our  positions as civil  servants and members of this panel , we cannot do  this by ourselves ,  as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau  ( civil service  laws ) from opening and / or operating foreign accounts  in our names  while still in government service , making it  impossible for us to  acquire the money in our names right now . i have  therefore , been  delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my  colleagues in the  panel to look for an overseas partner into whose  account we would  transfer the sum of us $ 31 million . hence we are  writing you this  letter . my colleagues and i have agreed that if you  or your company  can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our  behalf , you or your  company will retain 20 % of the total amount ( us $ 31  million ) , while  70 % will be for us ( officials ) and the remaining 10 %  will be used in  offsetting all debts / expenses and taxes incurred  both local and  foreign in the cause of this transfer . needless to  say , the trust  reposed on you at this juncture is enormous . in  return we demand your  complete honesty and trust .  you must however note that this transaction will be  strictly based  on the following terms and conditions as we have  stated below ;  a ) our conviction of your transparent honesty and  diligence  b ) that you would treat this transaction with utmost  secrecy and confidentiality  c ) that you will not ask for more share or try to  sit on the funds once it is under  your custody , or any form of blackmail .  d ) that upon receipt of the funds you will release  the funds as instructed  by us after you have removed your share of 20 % from  the total amount .  please , note that this transaction is 100 % legal and  risk free and we hope to conclude  this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days  from the date  of receipt of the necessary requirements from you .  we are looking  forward to doing business with you and solicit your  total confidentiality  in this transaction . there is no cause for alarm . i  give you my word that you  are completely safe in doing business with us .  transactions like this  have been successfully carried out in the past by  most government  executives . here in my country there is great  economic and political  disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant  and the order of  the day , thus explaining why you might have heard  stories of how  money is been taken out of nigeria , this is because  everyone is  making desperate attempts to secure his or her  future , so that when  we retire from active service we donot languish in  poverty . i will  explain more to you when i have heard from you .  please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using  the above e - mail address .  i will bring you into the complete picture of this  pending business  transaction when i have heard from you and also  receive your  confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me  fax to you all  necessary information you need to know about our  pending business  transaction . i will also send to you my private  telephone and fax  numbers where you can always reach me . your urgent  response will be  highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds  under the second  quarter of the year 2002 . thank you and god bless .  yours faithfully ,  dr . tom eke .  n . b . please be informed that this business  transaction is 100 % legal  and completely free from drug money or money  laundering . this is a  complete legitimate business transaction .  - -",1

"" breakthrough "" products in the vspc pipeline  vpsc products in the process of commercialization are expected to enable up to 10 hours of laptop computer usage , and three weeks of cell phone operation using fuel cells , gps - free navigation , especially for places where gps doesn ' t work ( a top dod priority ) , automated analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray imaging ( homeland security ) , identification of narcotics , chemicals , and biological weapons .  another total breakthrough , with a nanotechnology based mass spectrometer is a portable , carry - on suitcase size device that processes identifies one molecule at a time : further miniaturization is expected to shoebox size , compared with stationary desk size provided by today ' s competitors .  significant recurring income from fuel cell batteries  in five years , annual revenue from disposable fuel cartridges for fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices is expected to range between $ 7 billion on the low side to $ 45 billion on the high side . that market does not exist today .  vspc ' s fuel cell cartridge business model is similar to the well - known razor / razor blade model , which is to sell the razor and then make much more money on the recurring blade business . the fuel cell is a razor , and the disposable fuel cartridge is the razor blade .  another analogy is the  flashlight / battery model . imagine if a company had the primary intellectual property involved in manufacturing flashlights . it would probably license that technology to major flashlight manufacturers , in return for help in dominating the recurring flashlight battery business .  in this case vspc has the proprietary rights to the ' flashlight ' - - the fuel cell - - and intends to sell the "" flashlight battery "" - - specifically , disposable fuel cartridges , for an end - user price of $ 2 - $ 3 each .  vspc is currently negotiating to provide its patented fuel cell technology to major computer manufacturers , in return for their agreement to use disposable fuel cartridges developed by vspc , the manufacturing of which will be outsourced to well - known , major plants in the far east .  intellectual property protected with patents  vspc ' s fuel cell technology , for example , is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents .  strategic partners lend credibility  to create a cost - effective worldwide footprint , emerging companies must partner with branded , global companies who have strong management teams and significant resources .  vspc is partnering with major , well - known market leaders who have management , resources and global branding . partners are attracted to vspc ' s technology , and expect to gain competitive advantage by integrating patented , proprietary technology obtained from vspc .  for example , in the fuel cell business , toshiba , nec , sanyo , hitachi and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . these companies are potential strategic partners for vspc . to better work with japanese manufacturers , vspc has opened a tokyo office .

"Subject: wall street ' s dirty little secret . . .  it was the spring of 1979 .  i was just a tall , goofy looking kid in middle school  with buck - teeth and freckles . each day in the  cafeteria , i walked from table to table . . .  stealing other kids ' lunch money .  no , i didn ' t rob them with a gun or a knife - i just made  them a little deal . "" let me borrow two dollars today , "" i said ,  "" and i ' ll bring you five dollars next week . "" the investment  was too good to pass up , and other kids were throwing their  lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes . of course  when "" next week "" rolled around and i couldn ' t pony up the cash ,  i promised to pay them even more the week after that ,  if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit  longer .  eventually the end of the year came and went , high school  started and with it came girls , and homework , and parties ,  and sports , and those poor kids from eighth grade had more  things on their mind than last year ' s lunch money .  i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid ,  and i didn ' t even get beat up .  hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market  secrets you will ever learn .  first of all , greed is your number one enemy . you ' re not  going to turn $ 2 into $ 5 in a week , so cash out when  you ' re ahead . don ' t wait for the boat to sink before  grabbing the lifejacket .  second , never trust an investment adviser of any kind .  they are looking out for their own money , not yours .  the "" professionals "" , those stuffy investment counselors and  money managers , will always tell you that the best time to  buy is now . according to those guys , the longer you keep  your money in the market , the more money you ' re going to make .  ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is  "" never "" .  in a sense , they are right . if you put $ 250 , 000 in an index  fund right now , you ' ll probably have over a million dollars  in thirty or forty years . but here ' s the problem :  do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich ?  hell no !  you want the money now - so you can enjoy it . it ' s hard to  make use of your fortune when you ' re seventy years old  in a wheelchair . if you could make a million dollars in  the next few years , what would you do with it ? where would  you travel ? what kind of car would you buy ?  the fact is . . . youth is the best time to be rich .  if your goal is to make quick profits in the market , volatility  is your ally , and stability your enemy . you want to see  those large upswings , two hundred points in a day , followed  by the four hundred point crash a week later . you don ' t  care if the market went up or down 20 % this year as long  it was unstable . that ' s how you ' re going to make the  money .  what i ' m talking about here is day trading .  my father invests the traditional way ; he holds some good stocks  and he goes up 30 k and down 30 k . in the long term of 5 - 10 years  he makes money .  the day trader buys or sells 5 , 000 shares of xyz for a  $ 25 , 000 profit in a 5 - 10 minute trade . he acts quickly , taking  advantage of all the information at his disposal about a  certain stock , and estimating whether it will go up or  down within hours , sometimes within minutes .  i can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing  amounts of money at it . it ' s not rocket science , and you  only need to learn a few basic principles to get started .  society would have you believe that successful trading is  complicated and requires formal training .  the truth is , wealthy people use very simple investment  strategies to make money .  popular media and investment professionals portray successful  trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing  ring . they don ' t want the competetion - and they sure as hell  don ' t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm  to execute a trade for which they ' d charge you forty or fifty  dollars .  they make their money only if you believe two lies :  1 ) that investing is too difficult and risky for the average  person .  2 ) that using an investment adviser who charges a high  commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks  per trade .  here is what the financial gurus in today ' s society absolutely ,  positively do not want you to know . . .  the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact  so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend  a few hours of studying .  after reading over 200 financial books and publications  during the past decade , and after using day trading  to successfully make more than four million dollars in  the stock market , i ' ve learned the following lessons :  * * achieving financial success is incredibly simple .  * * anyone can do it .  * * it only takes a few hours to learn .  when i discovered the secret to day trading , i didn ' t become  wealthy overnight . if you want instant cash , drive to wal - mart .  buy a ski mask and a shotgun , and rob your local bank . the  only way to get rich , quick or otherwise , is through  hard work , knowledge , and determination .  after learning the fundamentals of day trading , i started  practicing the trading art itself , and the first few weeks  brought modest gains . the next few months gave me the practical  experience i needed to really earn a living , and i was pulling  close to a six figure income . in less than three years with no  formal financial training , minimal effort and only moderate risk ,  i had made my first million . the knowledge that i gained  during those formative trading years i am willing to share  with you in my new book , the master trader . you will learn from  my mistakes , and from my successes , as i teach you the simple ,  secret formula for day trading that i ' ve used profitably  year after year .  the income of the day trader can be staggering . thousands , even  hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within  minutes . the difference between making money and losing your  shirt is simply this : knowledge . i will provide that knowledge ,  and i will give you a winning edge at this high - stakes game .  average income of a day trader :  5 % average an income in excess of $ 500 , 000 per year  22 % average an income in excess of $ 250 , 000 per year  35 % average an income in excess of $ 100 , 000 per year .  27 % average an income between $ 50 , 000 and $ 99 , 999 per year  11 % average an income between $ 20 , 000 and $ 49 , 999 per year  after reading the master trader , you will discover extremely  profitable , simple yet powerful trading methods that give  you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you  win despite the current market weakness .  here is just a snippet of what i will teach you :  * * * make money whether a stock goes up or down .  * * * learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds .  * * * learn exactly what stocks to trade , the exact price to  buy them and the exact price to sell them .  * * * save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the  mistakes beginners make .  * * * learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money  consistently in every market !  * * * learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance  for great success .  * * * profit on huge intraday price swings .  * * * make money on the biggest news stories .  * * * actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum  returns .  * * * learn how to use the tools and information wall street  professionals use .  * * * learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind .  it ' s time to ask yourself : "" am i going to listen to the  professionals who say buy buy buy but never sell ? or am  i going to take control of my own financial future , and  start making money right now in the stock market ? ""  who is looking out for your best economic interests - some  wealthy wall street stockbroker , or yourself ?  with the master trader e - book , you will learn everything you  need to know in order to get started with day trading . . . from  choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the  lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional  trading strategies that make professional traders millions of  dollars .  the master trader e - book is the most comprehensive yet easy to  understand and straight - forward book ever written about active  trading . if you are serious about success in short term stock  trading - order today and start paving the road to your  own financial future .  oh , and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade ?  his high school friends laughed when he said he was going to  make money in the stock market .  six years later , he bought a beach - front home on the california  coast - with cash . oops , they weren ' t laughing anymore .  in a rollercoaster market like we have today , day trading  is the fastest track to wealth . if you ' re looking  for a long - term retirement investment with no risk  that goes up 5 % a year , then by all means , this ain ' t  your kind of game .  but if you want the quickest possible way to make a fortune  in the market , with the lowest element of risk , then  order the master trader e - book right now . i promise  to teach you all of the secrets that helped me become a  millionaire through successful day trading .  you don ' t need to know anything about the market , and  anyone can do it , with minimum effort . it ' s an easy  game to win if you know how the pieces move .  order the master trader e - book right now for only $ 49 . 97  by clicking on the link below :  http : / / 4 tools 4 life . com / qs  our company is strictly opposed to unsolicited emails .  to be removed from this list , please send an email  to "" bulkexpert @ yahoo . com "" ",1

"Subject: industry giants can ' t match this opportunity  another ground breaking news alert from rlyc .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  one company is quickly entering a $ 2 trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi - national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching . in just a few months , this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long - term customers that could generate tremendous re - occurring revenues for many years to come .  although you have probably never heard of this company , you may soon hear of it even if you don ' t continue reading this message . that ' s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u . s . within the next year .  an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry  in reality , this company ' s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you . since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don ' t know this company or what they plan to accomplish , their stock is trading at rock bottom prices . but , if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years , this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments .  the company that we ' ll introduce you to today is ( relay capital corp . pink sheets : rlyc ) . rlyc , which recently went public , is a multi - faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market . rlyc ' s present product and service offerings include pre - paid stored - value cards , reward cards , employee payroll cards , gift , retail and affinity group cards , travel cards and funds transfer cards . these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally .  just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn ' t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner . in order to be successful , that company also needs to be truly innovative , have very strong partners , be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality . rlyc appears to be that company .  below we ' ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  stored - value cards have the potential to help the 50 million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e - commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities . the implications reverberate across industry segments . estimates suggest stored - value transactions could exceed $ 2 trillion in just a few years .  rlyc ' s focus is on providing stored - value cards to the un - banked and under - banked . these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account , debit card . the size of that group is staggering that ' s about one - third of the nation ' s work force !  rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored - value card programs that make it easy , fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored - value cards as well as for the un - banked and under - banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards .  but that ' s not all . the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships . in this segment , relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer . who wouldn ' t want that ? the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc  for the under - and un - banked , collecting their pay , cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming . rlyc ' s stored - value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem .  rlyc ' s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un - banked alike ! lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u . s . cards , cards in foreign countries , and services bought through the cards , improved employee retention , improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc . various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system , while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or 24 hour access to their money through atms .  rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards  earlier this year , rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc ( click to go to their site ) , a leader in providing technical , craft and administrative staffing services to businesses , industry and government through locations in houston , dallas , long island , orlando , phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un - and under - banked populations .  the potential market for this service is really big . it includes large employers , companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers .  this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing , cutting , and mailing paper payroll checks . it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay , eliminate lost checks , stop payments and minimize fraud . but best of all , this should help to significantly boost rlyc ' s revenues .  $ 150 billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries  mexicans in u . s . send $ 16 . 3 billion a year back to mexico  with $ 150 billion being transferred internationally each year , remittances are a really big business . in times past , people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices . many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union . more recently , more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances .  the problems with traditional money transfer methods  with wire services , there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas . first , wiring funds across borders can be expensive . this can make it very cost - prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service . next there is the problem of logistics . both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company ' s services . even if they both are able to do this , the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them . lastly , the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose . these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives . so , even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money , it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use .  with money orders there is always the problem of mail service . although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service , this is not always the case in foreign countries . this is especially true in underdeveloped nations , where most remittances are sent . a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive . and , there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all , meaning that the sender ' s family could go hungry or end up on the streets .  what is the best way to send remittances ?  by far the most convenient , fast , safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored - value card . with this type of service , a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account ( onto the card ) via loading station , telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country .  the process is extremely easy and cost - effective . funds can be added to the card ' s account at an ever increasing number of convenient locations . the family member overseas can then draw down on those funds by presenting a card from that account to make purchases or they can use the card to withdraw cash from atms . it could not be any simpler .  rlyc has already begun filling orders  in june of this year , rlyc announced that it had received its first order for 2 , 000 pin - based stored value cards . the company stated that its growth estimates call for approximately 2 , 000 new stored - value cards being put into circulation each month . this could result in exponential revenue growth as new customers are added and its customers take advantage of its other financial services . moreover , though other programs it is working on , it could have one half million cards in the market within the next 18 months .  rlyc plans to expand its services through partner companies and one - stop financial centers  rlyc expects to fuel exponential growth of recurring revenue from individual card usage , monthly fees , as well as other activities occurring at its loading centers or the virtual financial centers it is planning . loading centers are retail locations , such as convenience stores , check cashing facilities or other types of retail facilities serving to dispense or receive cash facilitating transactions for the debit card consumer . rlyc has already established strategic relationships with leading card processors , vendors and distributors , and is in program development with key partners that may bring over 100 , 000 retail locations and a host of great opportunities to dramatically increase its brand recognition .  rlyc plans a host of new financial products and service offerings  some of the products and services rlyc plans to be launching in the coming months include commercial , auto and sba loans , mortgages , all types of affinity group ( loyalty / rewards ) cards , pharmacy discount cards , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health savings accounts and health and life insurance . rylc is expanding extremely rapidly and at this pace , should gain a whole lot of exposure to the investment community f - a - s - t ! ! !  rlyc plans to grow through joint ventures and acquisitions  through a well - planned strategy to partner with major players in the financial services industry and through key acquisitions of complimentary companies , rlyc plans to fuel its growth . it has begun identifying and will negotiate business joint ventures , acquisitions and partnerships within the stored value card industry .  rlyc is positioned to offer expanded payroll products as well as define a niche market for its private label stored value solutions . with corporate network ' s assistance , it expects to add new and expansive products linked to its card platform and provide its customers with a growing range of superior products and increased customer loyalty .  rlyc plans to enter the emerging high growth health savings account ( hsa ) market  rlyc has entered into an agreement in principle with mydaily corp . , an employee benefit and financial services company , to provide health saving account ( hsa ) stored value debit cards that will enable employees to easily pay routine medical bills with pre -

"Subject: immediate reply needed  dear sir ,  i am dr james alabi , the chairman of contract  award and review committee set up by the federal  government of nigeria under the new civilian  dispensation to award new contracts and review  existing ones .  i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and  reputable person to handle a very confidential  transaction , which involves the transfer of a huge  sum of money to a foreign account .  there were series of contracts executed by a  consortium of multi - nationals in the oil industry in  favor of n . n . p . c . the original values of these  contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum  of us $ 12 , 320 , 000 . 00 ( twelve million three hundred and twenty thousand  united  state dollars ) . this amount has now been approved and  is now ready to be transferred being that the  companies  that actually executed these contracts have been  fully paid and the projects officially commissioned .  consequently , my colleagues and i are willing to  transfer the total amount to your account for  subsequent disbursement , since we as civil servants  are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau ( civil  service law ) from operating and / or opening foreign  accounts in our names . needless to say , the trust  reposed on you at this juncture is enormous , in  return , we have agreed to offer you 20 % of the  transferred sum , while 10 % shall be set aside for  incidental expenses ( internal and external ) between  both parties in the course of the transaction you will  be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts  in due course .  modalities have been worked out at the highest level  of the ministry of finance and the central bank of  nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds  within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of  the above stated terms .  our assurance is that your role is risk free . to  accord this transaction the legality it deserves and  for mutual security of the funds the whole approval  procedures will officially and legally processed  with your name or the name of any company you may  nominate as the bonefide beneficiary .  once more i want you to understand that having put  in over twenty - five years in the civil service of my  country , i am averse to having my image and career  dented . this matter should therefore be treated with  utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves .  please you should signify your intention to assist  by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this  transaction , if favorable we will take further steps  to brief you the full details of this viable  transaction .  i want to assure you that this business proposal is  100 % risk free as we have done our homework  properly .  i quite believe that you will protect our interest  by taking this deal strictly confidential , as we are  still in government service , which we intend to  retire from in full honor .  kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to  enable us include this transfer in the next batch  which would constitute the new quarter payments  for the 2002 financial year .  thank you and god bless .  dr james alabi",1

( d ) number of automobiles worldwide - more than 1000 billion pieces  ( e ) daily loss caused due to vehicular accidents worldwide  more than 2 billion us $ per day .  ( 2 % of the worldwide gross national product of more than 36500 billion us $ = more than 730 us $ per year = more than 2 billion us $ per day )  theadvantages of the technology developed by us :  a . the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of auto - insurance . this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles . accordingly , the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction . additionally , because of saving of lives , the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantially .  b . as per the who studies and projections , road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today . it is projected by who that by the year 2020 they will occupy the number three positions , next only to heart disease and depression .  by introduction of this technology , we are sure that this will not happen . on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death , in the year 2020 at all .  c . this technology will therefore , make all vehicles cheaper and safer . not only will the cost be reduced , safety which is priceless in itself , will also be greatly enhanced .  as and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted , the life of the patent will be 20 years . even at the current levels , with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death , there is a daily loss of two billion us $ . even at the present level , over a period of twenty years , without any interest and without any compounding , this loss works out to be :  2 billion us $ x 365 days x 20 years - 14 , 600 billion us $ .  d . our technology will ensure that at least seventy - five percent of the above losses are prevented . such figure works out to be more that 10 , 000 billion us $ . it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level . as per the future projections , the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase . hence , the figure is likely to be increase very substantially . in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure further .  e . at the current levels , more than 1 . 2 million persons are dying every year due to road accidents . even at the current rates , more than 24 million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years ( i . e . life of the patent , when granted ) . besides , at the current levels .  3 . 2 million people are injured every year . in the next twenty years , the number of people injured due to road accident , will therefore be more than half a billion .  f . if we add to that the personal , physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents . the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings , are all unmeasurable in quantities , presently known to human kind .  g . considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove , it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity , computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankind .  h . the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that , in the very near future , the use of this technology will become unavoidable . it should and will become mandatory by law , to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a pre - requisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in future .  i . as described hereinabove ; this technology and its utility are incomparable , outthought of , and unheard of till date . it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures . in future , it can and will be applied to other mode of transport , like aircrafts and trains also .  . among other things , we have the following options available to us : - options  available to us : -  a - outright sale  ( a ) immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration .  ( b ) further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications , before taking steps as outlined in "" a "" .  the process ( b ) will obviously increase the realization in terms of price .  b - licencing options  i ) new vehicles - granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles , individually or collectively , all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis .  ii ) conversion of existing vehicles - to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than 1000 billion vehicles all over the world .  c - combined options  a collaborative arrangement with some private and / or government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a pre - decided sharing ( partnership ) arrangement .  the economics of the project will be as follows : -  1 ) in case any / all processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design of new vehicles and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs , the cost escalation may not be more than 5 % to 8 % , and the safety and the protection will be ten times ( more than ) the price escalation . hence , drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalation .  2 ) in case , the existing vehicles are modified , the cost involved will be approximately 10 % to 15 % of the value of the vehicle .  but partial modifications at a lower cost , which will give partial protection , may also be carried out . as a thumb rule , the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection provided .  3 ) in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire , the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable , as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protective .  4 ) there are more than 1000 billion motor vehicles in the world at present . besides there are an unspecified number of non - motorized ehicles .  5 ) almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree . the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there from .  6 ) among the motorised vehicles , the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out , but over all , some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiency .  7 ) even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of 300 us $ per vehicle , the conversion industry works out to be worth 3 , 00 , 000 billion us $ .  8 ) realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety , it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting date .  9 ) as pointed hereinabove , the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to , in the range of 1 , 00 , 000 billion us $ per year over the next three years .  10 ) alternatively , considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world , conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition . for such conversion , licenses can be granted on - line , on receipt of on - line payments . in that case , different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size , carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehicle .  11 ) in case , licensing is done , the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the end - user , as per his circumstances and needs . however , piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensing .  12 ) it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles , unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created . this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned . the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend and / or estimate .  p . s .  1 ) some of the figures have been rounded off but generally the figures are correct .  2 ) we have tried to keep this communication brief and to the point . more details , including website references are available with us and can be provided , if required .
